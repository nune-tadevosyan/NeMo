without permission from the company I would now like to introduce Ms Maureen Mulholland Senior Vice President General Counsel and Secretary of Monro Thank you please go ahead Thank you Hello everyone and thank you for joining us on this morning's call Before we get started please note that as part of the call this morning we will be referencing a presentation that is available on the investors section of our website at corporate.monro.com/investors/investor resources If I could draw your attention to the safe harbor statement on slide two of the presentation I'd like to remind participants on this morning's call that our presentation includes some forward looking statements about Monro's future performance Actual results may differ materially from those suggested by our comments today The most significant factors that could affect future results are outlined in Monro's filings with the SEC and in our earnings release The company disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward looking statements whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise except as required by law Additionally on today's call management statements include a discussion of certain non-gap financial measures which are intended to supplement and not be substitutes for comparable gap measures Reconciliations of such supplemental information to the comparable gap measures will be included as part of today's presentation and in our earnings release With that I'd like to turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer Brett Ponton Brett Thank you Maureen and good morning everyone Thanks for joining us I'll get started today with a brief overview of our third quarter results followed by an update on the progress we've made on our Monro Forward Strategy As illustrated on slide three we reported comps down 0.9% in the third quarter as hired year over year ticket was offset by negative traffic In October and the beginning of November we performed well against difficult comparisons in the prior year Mild weather conditions towards the end of November and in December caused the slow down across our core Northern markets These conditions have continued into January with our comparable store sales down 4% during the month We do not like talking about the weather however it is impossible to ignore the impact it has on our business While we are not satisfied with our financial results this quarter we are executing well against the areas within our control In particular we continue to move deeper into our company transformation and are confident we are on the right path We are committed to making the necessary changes across our organization to position us to deliver strong results no matter the external circumstances Moving on to our performance by category in the third quarter we were down 1% year over year in tire comparable store sales as higher ticket year over year was offset by a decline in tire volume We experienced more normalized retail price in this quarter and are focused on further refining our entire strategy to drive strength in our largest category Importantly we are on track to roll out our tire category management and pricing system beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 which will enable a more dynamic and sophisticated approach to real-time pricing I'll provide more details on this shortly According to our service and repair categories we saw a 3% decline in breaks year over year falling short of a difficult comparison in third quarter last year In maintenance we were flat while front-end stocks were down 1% and alignments declined 3% year over year Overall our Southern markets outperformed our Northern markets as expected given the mild winter weather conditions we faced in this region New stores added 22.7 million in revenue during the quarter including 20.7 million from recent acquisitions Regarding our first merger performance during the quarter we still had a client have 20 basis points compared to the prior year period primarily driven by the decrease in our comparable store sales which resulted in higher fixed costs as a percentage of sales Our variable margin on the other hand expanded due to lower year over year material costs as a percentage of sales while slightly higher than the prior year quarter technician labor as a percentage of sales decreased sequentially from last quarter This is a good example of us executing well against the areas within our control We identified issues last quarter that arose from our transformation and took corrective action to drive improved results We will have additional opportunities to continue to improve results in this area as we implement our cloud-based store staffing and scheduling model towards the end of this fiscal year which will be critical for us to seamlessly adjust to changes in demand demand dynamics without sacrificing sales I'd now like to turn to the progress we've made on our Monro Forward Strategy beginning with our store rebrand and re-image initiative on slide four This initiative focuses on creating a more consistent store appearance while also implementing standardized in-store operating procedures which we call our Monro playbook Additionally we are rebranding select stores to a tire oriented banner where targeted demographics favor this type of store format in order to increase tire sales without sacrificing service revenues During the first half of fiscal 2020 we finalized the transformations of our first group of stores which includes 44 locations in Rochester New York and the Mid-Atlantic as well as the second group which includes 43 stores in our Southern markets During the third quarter we continue to scale this initiative across our base and move forward with the transformation of 74 stores in four markets and 42 of our recently acquired California stores We have completed the transformation in the 74 stores and have substantially completed our California stores which are being rebranded under our tire choice auto service centers banner to drive higher awareness for tires Turning to slide five I'd like to provide some additional context regarding our strategic rationale as we transform our store base As many of you know we operate in two store formats our service brand stores which generate approximately $600,000 per store in annualized sales and our tire brands stores which generate approximately 1.2 million per store in annualized sales Prior to any rebrand activity we operated 555 service brands stores and 734 tire brand stores And as we work to create a nationwide chain of consistently operated stores we are prioritizing the higher volume tire brands Throughout this process we will be consolidating our regional brands focusing on shifting our service brands over to tire brand The lower number of brands will also allow us to improve our marketing productivity When we speak to re-imaging stores this primarily means modernizing the appearance of our stores with no associated brand change As we are making decisions regarding rebranding versus re-imaging stores we are leveraging our analytical model as well as taking into account our brand equity in that market Looking at the bottom left of the slide you can see here the progress we have made so far We are very much in the early innings of this transformation with 203 stores substantially completed out of our portfolio We separated these stores out between comp stores and non-comp stores which helps us to evaluate their performance post-refresh Of our approximately 900 comp stores that we set out to transform we've completed 134 stores and of our approximately 150 non-comp stores we have substantially completed 69 As we move forward with expanding this program across our base we will continue to prioritize markets that we expect will drive the largest benefit to our sales performance and our approach remeasured in order to keep sales disruption to a minimum Through the end of this fiscal year we're focusing on finalizing the transformation of our recently acquired California stores while starting the transformation of approximately 80 more stores that will be completed in Q1 of FY21 Moving on to the performance of the stores we've completed so far to help provide some additional granularity we separated out how rebranded stores have performed versus the stores that have just been re-imaged Importantly this data only includes comp stores that had a full quarter of performance following the completion of their transformation This is how we will speak to this performance excuse me of our transformed stores moving forward As you can see and in line with our expectations we see a significant sales lift when we rebrand stores This shift optimizes our brand awareness and increases our tire sales without sacrificing our service revenues The stores that have been re-imaged were slightly down as these are located in our Northern markets which were impacted by the mild weather conditions I mentioned earlier We believe this performance clearly highlights the strong opportunity we have and the benefits to come with a streamlined brand portfolio The 74 stores that we recently completed and are not included in this calculation given they have not had a full quarter post transformation yet but we are still we are seeing early signs of strength at these stores and are pleased with the results While we still have a while to go to roll this program out to our entire base to sustain performance we've seen at the stores that have completed the transformation today underscores the impact of this important initiative Turning to slide six and the remainder of our Monro Forward Initiatives I'd like to focus my discussion on the initiatives that are top priority which we believe will be critical to supporting our broader strategy In the third quarter we began modernizing our store IT infrastructure at all of our approximately 1300 locations This new infrastructure enables state-of-the-art technology including our new digital phone and texting system which is a major step towards improving the overall customer experience This system will allow us to better track customer execution driving a more consistent phone strategy and improve conversion Our store infrastructure monetization will be completed by the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2021 allowing us to leverage our new phone system which will be critical to driving traffic to our stores Another priority for us is the optimization of our tire category management We are on track and by the end of this fiscal year we expect our new pricing software will be operational We believe this will be critical to driving long-term margin expansion by providing improved visibility into demand dynamics allowing us to better refine our assortments and execute our strategy to become the number one destination for tires at any price point Finally we are right on track to roll out our cloud-based store scheduling model pilot by year end gaining real time visibility into our labor model via the cloud will help us be more effective and strategic ensuring we are not understaffed and losing sales or overstaffed when there is a lack of demand Regarding our other teammate initiatives we have rolled out the Monro University program to all of our teammates and are continuing to expand and enhance the course content We've also implemented mandatory onboard training to ensure that everyone who joins our team is trained on our Monro playbook operating procedures in order to provide a quality five-star experience to our customers Moving on to slide seven while we are very focused on the rollout of Monro Forward acquisitions remain a cornerstone of our growth strategy During the quarter we closed the previously announced acquisition of three companies one with 14 locations in Las Vegas Nevada and four in Boise Idaho as well as two companies that include nine stores in Northern California further solidifying our brilliant position in the Western United States Our presence in this region allows us to better service national accounts as well as benefit from the high concentration of vehicles in this market and the potential long-term consumership The acquisition in Nevada and Idaho which are new States to Monro is expected to add approximately 20 million in annualized sales representative sales make for 75% service and 25% tires The acquisitions in California expects to add approximately 25 million in annualized sales representatives sales makes a 55% service and 45% tires These ac- acquisitions are expected to be diluted to delude earnings per share in fiscal 2020 Overall acquisitions announced and completed in fiscal 2020 collectively represent an expected 120 million in annualized sales We operate in a very fragmented industry with significant opportunities for further consolidation And we believe we are well positioned to continue to execute on our robust pipeline of attractive M&A targets We currently have over 10 NDA signed with opportunities ranging from five to 40 stores which we believe will allow us to maintain our leadership position in the markets we serve while continuing to expand our geographic footprint into attractive and underserved regions Further by continuing to execute our Monro Forward Initiatives including our new brand standards and operating procedures we expect it integrate our new acquisitions more effectively and efficiently Lastly we opened one Greenfield location during third quarter bringing our total Greenfield store openings to seven in fiscal 2020 In conclusion we are confident we are on the right track to drive future success in our business We are in the early innings of a significant company transformation that will result in a platform capable of delivering sustainable longterm growth We are not there yet nor do we expect our results to be linear as we move through the transformation but we are committed to driving the necessary changes to improve our business making the appropriate course corrections when necessary and executing well against the areas within our control I'd like to thank the entire team at Monro for their exceptional work as we execute this strategy as well as our customers and shareholders for their continued support With that I'll turn the call over to our Executive Vice President Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer Brian D'Ambrosia who'll provide additional detail on our third quarter financial performance and fiscal 2020 outlook Thank you Brett and good morning everyone Turning to slide eight in our performance during the quarter Sells increased 6.2% year over year to $329.3 million driven by sales from new stores of $22.7 million including $20.7 million from recent acquisitions Partially offset by a decrease in sales from closed stores of approximately $0.8 million Same sales in the quarter were down 0.9% year over year The third quarter of fiscal 2020 had 89 selling days in line with the previous year period Those margins decreased 20 basis points to 37.8% in the third quarter of fiscal 2020 from 38% in the prior year period This decrease was partially due to an increase in distribution and occupancy costs as a percentage of sale as we lost leverage on these largely fixed costs with lower comparable store sales However as Brett mentioned we saw improvements in our variable margin driven by lower material costs as a percentage of sales Operating expenses for the quarter increased $5.5 million to $92.8 million or 28.2% of sales as compared with $87.3 million or 28.1% of sales for the prior year period The year over year dollar increase includes expenses from 103 net new stores Our operating income for the third quarter was $31.6 million which increased by 2.8% as compared to operating income of $30.7 million for the same quarter last year and decreased as a percentage of sales from 9.9% to 9.6% That interest expense for the third quarter increased $0.2 million to $7 million as compared to $6.8 million in the same period last year The weighted average outstanding for the third quarter of fiscal 2020 increased by approximately $112 million as compared to the prior year period The increase is primarily related to an increase in financing lease that recorded in connection with our fiscal 2020 acquisitions in Greenfield expansion as well as an increase in debt outstanding under our revolving credit facility to fund the purchase of our acquisition The weighted average interest rate for the third quarter decreased by approximately 140.2 basis year over year due to lower LIBOR and prime interest rates as well as lower borrowing rates associated with new leases Our effective tax rate was 24.1% for the third quarter compared to 15.3% for the same period last year The year over your year increase is primarily due to a one-time income tax benefit adjustment we realized in the prior year related to a retroactive accounting method change which was related to certain deductions that the IRS accepted during an examination of our fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2017 tax returns That income for the third quarter was $18.9 million compared to $20.5 million in the prior year period Diluted earnings per share for the third quarter of fiscal 2020 were 56 cents compared to diluted earnings per share of 61 cents in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 Adjusted diluted earnings per share which is a non-gap measure for the third quarter of fiscal 2020 was 60 cents which excludes from diluted earnings per share 3 cents of costs related to Monro Forward Initiatives and 1 cent of cost related to acquisition due diligence and integration This compares to adjusted diluted earnings per share of 57 cents in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 which excluded 1 cent of costs related to Monro Forward Initiatives 1 cent of non-recurring corporate and field management realignment costs and 6 cents benefits from the one-time income tax adjustment",

transformation of the seventy four stores and substantially completed our california stores which are being reprinted under our higher choice auto service centers banner to drive higher awareness retires turning to slide five i'd like to provide some additional context regarding our strategic rationale as we transform our store base as many of you know we operate in two store formats our service brand stores which generate approximately six hundred thousand dollars per store in annualized sales and are tire brand stores which generate approximately one million two hundred thousand prior to any rebrand activity we operated five hundred and fifty five service brand stores and seven hundred and thirty four tire brand stores and if we work to create a nationwide chain of consistently operated stores we are prioritizing the higher volume tire brand throughout this process we will be consolidating our regional brands focusing on shipping our service brands over the tire

during the quarter sales increase six two percent year over year to three hundred and twenty nine three million dollars driven by sales from new stores of twenty two seven million dollars including

nine percent year over year the third quarter of fiscal two thousand and twenty had eighty nine selling days in line with the previous year period rose margin decreased twenty basis points to thirty seven point eight percent in the third quarter of fiscal two thousand and twenty from thirty eight percent in the prior year period decrease was partially due to an increase in distribution and occupancy costs as a percentage of sales as we lost leverage on these largely fixed costs with lower comparable store sales however as brett mentioned we saw improvements in our variable margin driven by lower material costs as a percentage of sale operating expenses for the quarter increased five hundred thousand dollars to ninety two eighty million dollars or twenty eight two percent of sales as compared with eighty seven three hundred thousand dollars or twenty eight one percent of sales for the prior year period the year over year dollar increase includes expenses from one hundred three not

million dollars to seven million dollars as compared to six eight million dollars in the same period last year the weighted average debt outstanding for the third quarter of fiscal two thousand and twenty increased by approximately one hundred twelve million dollars as compared to the prior year period the increase is primarily related to an increase in financing lease that recorded in connection with our fiscal two thousand and twenty acquisitions and greenfield expansion as well as an increase in debt outstanding under our evolving credit facility to fund the purchase of our acquisition the weighted average interest rate for the third quarter decreased by approximately one hundred forty basis points year over year due to lower libel or and prime interest rates as well as lower borrowing rates associated with new leases are effective tax rate was twenty four point one percent for the third quarter compared to fifteen point three percent for the same period last year

of adjusted diluted earnings per share to diluted earnings per share in our earnings release Lastly we opened one Greenfield location during the third quarter as a reminder Greenfield stores include new construction as well the acquisition of one to four store operations Greenfield locations on average are expected to add approximately $1 million each annual sales As of December 28th 2019 the company had 1,289 company operated stores and 99 franchise location as compared with 1,186 company operated stores and 99 franchise locations as of December 29 2018 During the third quarter we had a 27 company operated stores and closed none Turning to slide nine We continue to maintain our disciplined approach to capital allocation as we execute our growth strategy Our capital expenditures were $42.2 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2020 of which approximately $18 million was related to investments in our Monro Forward Initiative We are pleased with the progress of our Monro Forward Strategy and we continue to expect an incremental $75 million in capital expenditures above our normal run rate over five years to support investments in story image and technology Additionally a creative acquisition support our our growth strategy During the first nine months of the year we spent approximately $104 million on acquisitions including one to four store acquisitions completed as part of our Greenfield expansion strategy As Brett mentioned acquisitions announced and completed in fiscal 2020 collectively represent an expected $120 million in annualized sales I'd like to provide some additional clarity here The $120 million in sales represents the expected run rate for these stores once they have been fully integrated which as we've stated in the past is usually in year three post- it's acquisition During years one and two following the acquisition we typically see a step-down in sales given the process of onboarding new stores to our model Moving on we continue to be committed to returning capital to our shareholders through our dividend program and paid approximately $22 million in dividends in the first nine months of fiscal 2020 Finally we remain focused on maintaining a solid balance sheet with ample flexibility to support our strategic growth initiatives We entered the third quarter with strong leverage ratios and have ample room under our financial covenant We generated approximately $125 million of cash flow from operating activities during the first nine months of fiscal 2020 and debt under our revolving credit facility increased by approximately $59 million Now turning to our outlook for fiscal 2020 on slide 10 We have updated our fiscal 2020 comparable store sales guidance range to a decrease of 1% to flat to reflect the impact of our year to day performance Based on the updated comparable store sales guidance and the contribution from recently closed acquisition we now anticipate fiscal 2020 sales to be in the range of $1 billion $275 million to 1 billion $290 million an increase of 6.2% to 7.5% as compared to fiscal 2019 sales This compares to the previous sales guidance range of $1 billion $295 million to $1 billion $315 million Our guidance assumes relatively stable overall tire and oil costs for the balance of fiscal 2020 Given the impact of our year to day performance we expect fiscal 2020 earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $2.25 cents to $2.35 cents representing a decline of 5.1% to 0.8% year over year compared to $2.37 cents in fiscal 2019 This compares to the previous guidance of $2.45 to $2.55 cents On an adjusted basis which is a non-gap measure the company when he expects diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $2.35 cents to $2.45 cents representing a decline of 1.7% to growth of 2.5% which excludes from diluted earnings per share Monro Forward Initiative costs and acquisition due diligence and integration costs This compares to adjusted diluted earnings per share of $2.39 cents in fiscal 2019 which excluded Monro Forward Initiative costs non-recurring corporate and field management realignment cost acquisition due diligence and integration costs and the benefit from the one-time income tax adjustment Acquisitions announced and completed in fiscal 2020 are expected to be diluted to earnings per diluted share during the year At the midpoint of our guidance range we expect an operating margin of approximately 10.2% interest expense to be approximately $29 million depreciation and amortization to be approximately $65 million and EBITDA to be approximately $196 million We expect capital expenditures to be approximately $60 million this year This guidance reflects an effective tax rate of approximately 23.5% and is based on 34 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding As always our guidance does not assume any future acquisitions or Greenfield store openings I'll now turn the call over to Brett to provide some closing remarks before we move to Q and A Thanks Brian We are making strong strides in the execution of our Monro Forward strategy in particular our store rebrand and re-imaging initiative The strong results of the locations that have completed this transformation underscore our confidence in this initiative The store rebrand and re-emerge program is further supported by our technological investments which we believe will help drive long-term margin expansion In summary we remain committed to driving the necessary changes to improve our business making the appropriate course corrections when necessary and executing well against the areas within our control We are excited for our future and look forward to capitalizing on the attractive opportunities ahead With that I will now turn the call over to the operator for questions Thank you At this time we will be conducting a question and answer session If you would like to ask a question please press * 1 on your telephone keypad A confirmation tone will indicate your line is in the question queue You may press * 2 if you would like to remove your question from the queue For participants using speaker equipment it may be necessary to pick up your handset before pressing the star keys Once again that is * 1 to register questions at the time Our first question is coming from Brian Nagel of Oppenheimer Please go ahead Good morning Morning Brian So I wanna foc- and I I apologize for uh focusing on the weather here but I do I do just wanna dive a little deeper into uh sales trends in the quarter So Brett you mentioned I think Brian you did too on in your prepared comments just you made some comment commentary suggesting that you know to the degree to which weather impacted the business I was wondering if you could drill down a little further and say you know what that negative 0.9 comp you know would have been had the weather cooperated and some of the other the other metrics you're seeing that really suggest the underlying businesses is trending better than what we saw uh in the in the weather affected uh fiscal Q3 Yeah I'll take the first part and I'll let Brian take the second part of the question Brian Uh when we look at the performance in the quarter as we've talked about our Northern markets certainly underperformed than Southern markets and I'll give you a little more granularity on that Uh certainly our stores up in the Northeast um and the Midwest were where you would expect to have more exposure to weather conditions uh like you have in the Northeast certainly under perform I think it's difficult to say what we would have done um you know certainly I think we were expecting you know positive comps in the quarter Uh our internal uh expectations would have been closer to plus one or plus one and a half uh assuming normalized weather conditions that we have seen in the past Uh we felt really good coming out of October November given the strength of last year's performance that we were competing against And and didn't get the cooperation from the weather in December that we were certainly expecting Uh as I made the the comments in my prepared remarks we certainly don't like talking about the weather Brian but we can't ignore the fact that when 50% of our business is tires and we have a high concentration of stores in the Northeast and Midwest we are going to have outsized exposure to uh our account performance Brian would you mind maybe taking restating the second part of your question Well I think look I think you've covered Right maybe I'll just bounce right I have a follow-up question if I if I could So the guide the the adjusted guidance and you you mentioned so in January you were did uh I think a negative four Now if I'm doing the math it looks as though that the adjusted guidance would suggest some type of pickup then in business in in February March I I guess the first question is is that assumption correct And then the following question is and I know we've seen this before with your business but you know at what point does because we still have a long we have potentially a long time in the winter the weather could still come but is there a point at which in in in the quarter where the the weather just comes too late Yeah So so Brian your assumption is correct um regarding the uh regarding the implied comps So if you think about Q4 at the mid point uh of let's say down 0.5 for the full year down 0.5 that implies Q4 of down two which would uh be about February and March being down one in order to get to that down two So that that's the dynamic at the midpoint So there is an expectation of uh of a pickup in February and March And and Brian maybe just to comment on the second part um- Yeah You know as we get deeper into the fourth quarter our fourth quarter and the second half of the quarter in particular I think we've become less sensitive to the weather as you transition out of the pure winter conditions into uh spring Um certainly I think you know that later in the quarter you get snow falls certainly doesn't have the same impact on tire demand like you would find in our business if we got snowfall in October or November Uh consumers are pretty uh thrifty with their money and I believe if you get snowfall late in the season they have a tendency to forgo that first purchase and push it out until next season in particular The other thing to call out uh as well as if you look at our store performance at the company uh December and January have always been the most volatile volatile months that we had to contend with And I think what we've seen in past performance here um friends coming out of December January don't necessarily reflect what you see in the spring Uh so um given the the mild December January heading into um the balance of the quarter we feel pretty good about the guidance range we provided as Brian said our midpoint assumes that On the low end of our comp sales guidance that assumes run rate coming out of January which we certainly believe we're gonna be better than that as we roll into FY21 I I appreciate all the color Thank you Thanks Brian Thank you Our next question is coming from Jonathan Lamers of BMO Capital Markets Please go ahead Thanks Um Brett looking at your slide on the store rebranding uh you know the 18% performance of the rebranded stores Um I think it's good Uh I'm I'm curious from your analytic model how many years should it take a rebranded store to reach projected run rate sales Well if you look at look at the top quadrant of that slide Jonathan um we've shared you know with investors the fact that our service stores do roughly $600,000 in revenue and our tire stores do a million too So in a case where we're rebranding a service store your you're working off a base on average of 600,000 and if we've seen I'll call it a double digit comp improvement off of that base you can get to implied number certainly on how fast or how long it would take to ramp to uh the full maturity equally and the average sales uh performance of our tire branded stores And that's one of the things that's encouraging about the strategy for us so it's not that it's just a one-time step up in sales This creates the opportunity to create multiple years of uh sustainable growth as our brand and our positioning uh our brand related to tires starts to mature Uh keep in mind the tire purchase cycle with consumers is anywhere from two to four years so if we rebrand right before a consumer made that decision to buy tires uh we won't be relevant necessarily to that consumer for two to three years out So uh so to put that on a timeline that you're looking at three to five years to certainly mature out to average sales performance of a tire brand store Okay So just to circle up on that for the stores where you're rebranding there's nothing about their market um like you you would expect that those stores would have sales comparable to your existing tire brand stores of the 1.2 million Is that correct Yeah As a general statement that's correct I think certainly you're gonna have markets that will exceed the average and you'll have some markets that will be lower than that And that's part of the choices that we that we make using the analytic model But but on average as we look across our I'll say the opportunity stores at the end of 555 I think we feel very comfortable on average that we can reach the full potential of the 1.2 over time as they mature Thanks Uh switching gears Brian how much of a headwind um to that uh revenue from acquisition were the conversions of the 42 California stores this quarter Yeah I mean we we had uh you know some disruption there Um I would say you know uh we we haven't really quantified that um from a from a sales standpoint But you know that's a great point Jonathan and that we have uh immediately put the new stores that we acquire on the Monro playbook uh and then shortly thereafter and in this case about six months uh get the re-image uh in store brand standards in place Uh so those uh in Q3 uh the 42 California stores went through that Um and there were substantially through that uh uh as of the end of Q3 Um so we're we haven't quantified it but it certainly had some impact on their sales performance in the quarter Okay And that 1.8 million charge for Monro Forward Initiative uh this quarter what was that for Yeah it was all related to the store rebrand and re-image um and it falls into three primary buckets uh related to that Uh the first is non-capital uh items that we send to the stores So as we think about uh updated uh safety chains updated bay banners updated point of sale marketing materials all of these things to get the store initially to uh the standard uh that are not capital uh in terms of the actual uh work and construction done on the store That's the first bucket The second bucket is non-capital work that's actually done We get into these stores and we identify non-capital repairs uh demolition uh as well as um some of the fixed verse replaced items for example stripping a floor and redoing a floor versus installing a new floor Those are things that uh make sense economically but you get different treatment from expense versus capital for so that's the second bucket And the third is just right off of existing leaseholds in the stores Uh anything from counters to uh maybe some existing signage that was put up as part of an acquisition when we initially branded the stores over to a Monro brand Um those are the three primary buckets that uh that the the Monro Forward Initiative costs uh consist of Okay Thanks for your comments Thank you Excuse me Our next question is coming from Bret Jordan of Jefferies Please go ahead Hey good morning guys Morning Bret Morning Bret Hey uh back to slide five I guess if we look at the 18% growth in rebranded stores if were to look at the comparable growth there you know X the new product lines you're adding how's the service um comp against the service comp in those stores Are you saying you know a pickup as you change the brand Yeah Maybe just to clarify though Bret I think we're actually not adding any new products to the service menu Uh Right right Yeah it's just a mix right so we even our service stores they sell tires it's only 15% of their mix So we're certainly seeing growth more outsized growth in other tire sales And we've had success in maintaining uh the rate of growth that we've seen on the service side which has been part of our thesis is uh hold on uh to the service business that enjoyed it's high margin uh and then add to that more relevancy to the marketplace on tires and drive the growth through the the tire category on both sides Okay And I guess when we look at the re-image how does that compare to you know comparable service stores in the network that hadn't been re-imaged I guess sort of looking at it again sort of apples to apples you know against the old stores Yeah I think if uh if you can figure out what stores we're talking about there the 30 stores are Rochester I think- Yeah The Rochester store certainly if they have been performing quite well uh relative to what our expectations were on re-image We certainly didn't expect to see double digit growth rates out of the re-imaged store we set out to do this initiative Uh but we were seeing a more positive growth out of the stores up until the last quarter uh given the exposure that we've had to uh the weather in the North But compared to other stores uh we're still pleased with what we're seeing from a customer service point of view and from a comp sale point of view relative to their peers uh facing similar I would say market backdrop from a weather point of view Okay Could you give us I guess sort of the the the spread between the Southern store comp and the Northern store comp you know how big a Delta was it I mean it was it was uh a couple of hundred basis points of performance Okay And I guess for housekeeping could you give us the monthly Uh", "pred_text": "on this non gap measure please see the reconciliation of adjusted diluted earnings per share to dilute earnings per share in our earnings really lastly we opened one greenfield location during the third quarter as a reminder greenfield stores include new construction as well as the acquisition of one to four store operation greenfield locations on average are expected to add approximately one million dollars each in annual sales as of december twenty eighth two thousand and nineteen the company had one thousand two hundred and eighty nine company operated stores and ninety nine franchise location as compared with one thousand one hundred and eighty six company operated stores and ninety nine franchise locations as of december twenty ninth two thousand and eighteen during the third quarter we had a twenty seven company operated stores and closed none turning to slide nine we continue to maintain our disciplined approach to capital allocation as we execute our growth strategy our capital expenditures were forty two point two million and the first nine months of fiscal two thousand and twenty of which approximately eighteen million dollars was related to investments in our monroe forward initiative we are pleased with the progress of our monroe forward strategy and we continue to expect an incremental seventy five million dollars in capital expenditures above our normal run rate over five years to support investments in story image and technology additionally a creative acquisition support our growth strategy during the first nine months of the year we spent approximately one hundred four million dollars on acquisitions including one to four store acquisitions completed as part of our green field expansion strategy as brett mentioned acquisitions announced and completed in fiscal two thousand and twenty collectively represent an expected one hundred and twenty million dollars in annual i sales i'd like to provide some additional clarity here the one hundred and twenty million dollars in sales represents the expected run rate for these stores once they have been fully integrated which as we've stated in the past is usually in year three post acquisition during years one and two following the acquisition we typically see a step down in sales given the process of onboarding new stores to our model moving on we continue to be committed to returning capital to our shareholders to our dividend program and paid approximately twenty two million dollars in dividends in the first nine months of fiscal two thousand and twenty finally we remain focused on maintaining a solid balance sheet with ample flexibility to support our strategic growth initiative we entered the third quarter with strong leverage ratios and have ample room under our financial covenant we generated approximately one hundred twenty five million dollars of cash flow from operating activities during the first nine months of fiscal two thousand and twenty and that under our revolving credit facility increased by approximately fifty nine million dollars now turning to our outlook for fiscal two thousand and twenty on flight time we have updated our fiscal two thousand and twenty comparable store sales guidance range to a decrease of one percent to flat to reflect the impact of our year to day performance based on the updated comparable store sales guidance and the contribution from recently closed acquisition we now anticipate fiscal two thousand and twenty sales to be in the range of one billion two hundred and seventy five million dollars to one billion two hundred and ninety million dollars an increase of six two percent to seven five percent as compared to fiscal two thousand one hundred sales this compares to the previous sales guidance range of one billion two hundred and ninety five million dollars to one billion three hundred and fifteen million dollars our guidance assumes relatively stable overall tire and oil costs for the balance of fiscal two thousand and twenty given the impact of our year to day performance we expect fiscal two thousand and twenty earnings for diluted share to be in the range of two dollars twenty five cents to two dollars thirty five cents representing a decline of five one percent to eight percent year over year compared to two dollars thirty seven cents in fiscal two thousand and nineteen this compares to the previous guidance of two dollars forty five cents to two dollars fifty five cents on an adjusted basis which is a non gap measure the company expects diluted earnings per share to be in the range of two dollars thirty five cents to two dollars forty five cents representing a decline of one seven percent to growth of two five percent which excludes from diluted earnings per share monroe ford initiative costs and acquisition due diligence and integration costs this compares to adjusted diluted earnings per share of two dollars thirty nine cents in fiscal two thousand and nineteen which excluded monroe ford initiative costs non recurring corporate and field management realignment cost acquisition due diligence and enter gratian costs and the benefit from the one time income tax adjustment acquisitions announced and completed in fiscal two thousand and twenty are expected to be diluted to earnings precluded share during the year at the midpoint of our guidance range we expect an operating margin of approximately ten two percent interest expense to be approximately twenty nine million dollars depreciation and amortization to be approximately sixty five million dollars and even to be approximately one hundred and ninety six million dollars we expect capital expenditures to be approximately sixty million dollars this year this guidance reflects an effective tax rate of approximately twenty three five percent and is based on thirty four million diluted weighted average shares outstanding as always our guidance does not assume any future acquisitions or greenfield store openings i'll now turn the call over to broad right some closing remarks before we move to q night thanks brian we are making solid strides in the execution of our monroe forward strategy in particular our store rebrand and reimage initiative the strong results of the locations that we did this transformation underscore our confidence in this initiative story brand and reimage program is further supported by our technological investments which we believe will help drive long term margin expansion in summary remain committed to driving necessary changes to improve our business making the appropriate course corrections when necessary and executing well against the areas within our control we are excited for future and look forward to capitalizing on the attractive opportunities ahead with that turn the call over to the operator for questions thank you at this time we will be conducting a question and answer session if you would like to ask a question please press star one on your telephone keypad a confirmation tone will indicate your line is in the question q you may press start to if you would like to move your question from the queue for participants using speaker equipment it may be necessary to pick up your handset before pressing the star keys once again that is star want to register questions at this time our first question is coming from brian nagle of oppenheimer please go ahead good morning so i want to focus i apologize for focusing on the weather here but i do i do just want dive a little deeper into sales trends of the quarter so brad you mentioned i think right that you did to on your and you prepared comments just you made some comment you know commentary suggesting that to the degree to which weather impacted the business i want to control down a little further and say you know what that negative point nine comp you know would have been had the weather cooperated and some of the other the other metrics you're saying that really suggest the underlying business is trending better than what we saw in the weather affected fiscal three i'll take the first part and i'll let brian take the second part of the question brian when we look at the performance in the quarter as we talked about our northern market certainly under form the southern markets and give a little more granularity on that certainly our stores up in the northeast and the midwest were where you would expect to have more exposure to weather conditions like you have in the north be certainly underperform i guess difficult to say what we would have done certainly i think we were expecting positive comps in the quarter or internal expectations would have been closer to plus one plus one and a half assuming normalized weather conditions that we have seen in the past we felt really good coming out of october november given the strength of last year's performance that we were competent against and didn't get the cooperation from the weather and december that we were certainly expecting as i made the comments in my prepared remarks we certainly don't like talking about the weather brian but we can't ignore the fact that when fifty percent of our businesses tiresome we have a high concentration of stores in the northeast and midwest we are going to have outsized exposure to our account performance you mind restating the second part of your question why i think i think look i think it covered right maybe i'll just bounce follow up question if i if i could so the guy that the adjusted guidance that you mentioned so in january you were did i think a negative for if i'm doing the math it looks as though that the adjusted guidance would suggest some type of pick up that business and in february march or because the first question is that assumption correct and then the following question is you know i know we've seen this before with your business but you know what point we start along we have potentially a long time in the winter the weather could still come but is there a point at which in the quarter where the weather just comes too late so brian your assumption is correct regarding the regarding the implied comp so if you think about q four at the midpoint of let's say down point five for the full year down point five that implies q four of down two which would be about february and march being down one in order to get to that down to so that that's the dynamic at the midpoint so there is an expectation of a of a pick up in february and march and brian maybe just comment on the second part it was we get deeper into the fourth quarter or fourth quarter of the second half of the quarter in particular i think we become less sensitive to the weather as you transition out of pure winter conditions into spring certainly i think you know the later in the quarter you get snowfall certainly doesn't have the same impact on tire demand like you would find in our business if we got snowfall in october or november consumers are pretty with their money and i believe it gets no fall late in the season they have a tendency to forego that persh purchase and push it out till next season in particular the other thing to call out as well as you look at our historic performance of the company december and january have always been the most volatile volatile months that we had to contend with and i think what we've seen in past performance here friends coming out of december january don't necessarily reflect what you see in the spring month so given that the mild december january heading into the balance of the quarter we feel pretty good about the guidance range we provided as brian said our midpoint assumes that on the low end of our comp still guidance that assumes run rate coming out of january which we certainly believe we're going to be better than that as a role in the twenty one i appreciate all the color thank you thanks thank you our next question is coming from jonathan lehmers up the m o capital markets please go ahead thanks brett looking at your slide on the story branding you know the eighteen percent performance of the rebranded or i think it's good i'm curious from your analytic model how many years should it take a rebranded store to reach projected run rate sales but if you look at look at the top quadrant about fly we've shared with investors the fact that our service stores the roughly six hundred thousand dollars in revenue in our tire store to a million to so in the case we're rebranding a service store you're working off a base on average of six hundred thousand and if we've seen a call a double digit comp improvement off of that base you can get to implied number certainly on how fast how long it would take to ramp to the full maturity equally the average sales performance of our tire brain of stores and that's one of the things that's encouraging about strategy for us is not that it's just a one time step up in sales this creates the opportunity to create multiple years of sustainable growth as our brand in our positioning our brand related tires start mature keep in mind the tire purchase cycle with consumers is anywhere from two to four years so if we rebrand right before a consumer made that decision to buy tires we won't be relevant necessarily that consumer for two to three years out so to put that on a timeline of it you're looking at three to five years to certainly mature out to average sales performance of a tybrant or ok just to circle up on for the boards where you're rebranding there's nothing about their market like you would expect that those stores would have sales comparable to your existing tire brand stores the one two million is that correct yeah as a general statement that's correct i think certainly you're going to have markets that will exceed the average you know some markets that will be lower than that and that's part of the choices that we that we make using the analytic model but what on average as we look across the opportunity stores that be in the five hundred and fifty five i think we feel very comfortable on average that we can reach the full potential of the one two over time as they mature thanks switching gears brian how much of a headwind to that revenue from acquisition where the conversions of the forty two california stores this quarter yeah i mean we had you know some disruption there i would say you know we haven't really quantified that from a from a sale standpoint but you know that's a great point jonathan and that we have immediately put the new stores that we acquire on the monroe playbook and then shortly thereafter and this case about six months get the reimage in store brand standards in place so those include three forty two california stores went through that and they're substantially through that as of the end of q three we haven't quantified it but it certainly had some impact on their sales performance in the quarter ok and that one million eight hundred thousand charge for monroe ford initiative this quarter what was that for it was all related to the store rebranded re image and it falls into three primary buckets related to that the first is not capital items that we send to the stores so as we think about updated safety chains updated bay banners updated point of scale marketing material all of these things to get the store initially to the standard that are not capital in terms of the actual work and construction done on the store that's the first bucket the second bucket is not capital work that's actually done we get into these stores

counters to maybe some existing signage that was put up as part of an acquisition when we initially branded the stores over to a monroe brand those are the three primary buckets that the monroe ford initiative cost consist of ok thanks for a comment thank you and give me our next question is coming from fred jordan of jeffrey's please go ahead good morning guys were back to slide five i guess if we look at the eighteen percent growth and rebranded stores if we really to look at the comparable growth there you know x the new product lines you're adding how does the service against the service comp in those stores are you saying pick up as you change the brand yeah maybe just to clarify the bread i think we're actually not adding any new products to the service menu back to drag fire just mix right so we even our service stores they sell tires it's only fifteen percent or mix so we're certainly seeing growth more outside growth in other tire sales and we've had success in maintaining the rate of growth that we've seen on the service side which has been part of our thesis hold on to the service business that we've enjoyed that's high margin and then add to that more relevancy to the marketplace on tires and drive the growth through the tire category on both sides ok i guess we look at the reimage how does that compare to comparable service stores in the network that hadn't been reimagined i guess sort of looking at again sort of apples to apples against the old stores i think if you can figure out what stores we're talking about there the thirty stories around chester and i think the rochester store certainly they have been performing quite well relative to what our expectations were on re image we certainly didn't expect to see double digit growth rates out of a re image store we set out to do this initiative but we were seeing more positive growth of the stores up until the last quarter given the exposure that we've had to the weather in the north but compared to other stores we're still pleased with what we're seeing from a customer service point of view and from a comp sale point of view relative to their peers facing similar market backdrop from a weather point of view ok could you give us i guess sort of the spread between the southern store cop and the northern storecob you know how they get delta was it i mean it was it was a couple hundred basis points of performance and i guess for housekeeping could you give us the monthly yes", "wer": 0.2958488228004957, "tokens": 3228, "ins_rate": 0.06753407682775713, "del_rate":

location is operating at normal levels with virtually all employees reporting to work We've also built a stable long-term supply base in China and we work with vendors who favor Culp due to our strong trusted relationship We've experienced minimal delays as most of our suppliers have backed nearly full output and continue to prioritize our production We've also relocated a considerable amount of our cut and sew production to two facilities we work with in Vietnam Likewise in both our mattress fabrics and home accessories business we are not currently experiencing any delays in Asia and we also have significant alternative locations for production has needed This includes production or sourcing capabilities in the US Canada Haiti Vietnam and Turkey While we cannot predict whether the virus will have any negative impact on consumer confidence on US consumer market we believe our solid and stable supply chain and our global platform supports our ability to manage any disruption created by the outbreak Now we'll turn to the third quarter results As previously announced our results for the quarter reflected unexpected sales particularly in our core business segments while several external factors affected our results for the third quarter we believe Culp is well positioned for the medium and long-term Our global platform is reactive and is a distinct competitive

down 6.8% compared with the prior year period On a pre-tax GAAP basis the company reported a net loss of 5.1 million compared with a pre-tax income of 4.3 million for the third quarter of last year as previously di- disclosed a few weeks ago on February 18th the results for the third quarter the current fiscal year include a reversal of a 6.1 million recorded contingent earn-out liability as well as non-cash impairment charges a 13.6 million related to the home accessory division resulting in a non-cash net charge of 7.6 million excluding this net charge adjusted pretax income non- GAAP was 2.4 million for the third quarter of this fiscal year The financial results for the third quarter of last fiscal year included approximately 769,000 in restructuring and related charges and credits and other non-recurring items due mostly to the closure of the company's Anderson South Carolina production facility Excluding this net charge presets income for the third quarter of last year was 5 million Net loss attributed to Culp Inc shareholders was $58,000 or zero cents per diluted share for the third quarter compared with net income of 3.2 million or 25 cents per diluted share for the prior year period The results of the third quarter of both fiscal year include the respect of charges and restructuring related credits I just noted The effective income tax rate was 19% for the third quarter and 142.8% for the year-to-date period for this fiscal year The company's high effective income tax rate for the year-to-date period reflects the significant decline in the company's projected annual consolidated taxable income particularly in the US which includes the income tax effects of the asset impairment charges as previously discussed as well as the mix of consulting taxable income that is earned by the company's foreign operations located in China and Canada that have higher higher income rates in relation to the US The current mix of taxable income has led to a significant increase in the effect of income tax rate that is associated with our global intangible low tax income or guilty tax which represents a US income tax on foreign earnings Importantly income taxes incurred in the US on a cash basis for fiscal 2020 uh expect the minimal due to the projected utilization of the company's US federal net operating loss carry forwards and immediate expensing of US capital expenditures Looking ahead to the rest of this fiscal year we estimate that our consolidated effective income tax rate will remain high and be in the 120% 130% range based on the fact that we know today and as effected by the factors noted above Notably the US treasury department and internal revenue service having issued newly proposed regulations that if and when enacted and if enacted that's proposed could provide us with some relief from the guilty tax out of the proposed guilty high tax exceptional election beginning of fiscal 2021 or later subject to the timing of enactment and subs to any determination by the US treasury department and IRS that the exceptions should apply retroactive retroactive The proposed guilty tax high tax exception election is not available until the proposed regulations are finalized and effective If the proposed guilty tax exception election is enacted as proposed and becomes effective for our fiscal 2021 year And assuming we do not have non-recurring charges or impairments that would reduce our pre-tax income then based on current assumptions we would estimate our tax rate for fiscal 2021 to to be in the range of 35 to 50% However let me stress that there are a lot of moving parts that affect this rate including the many factors I've discussed previously So this estimate could change Trailing 12 month adjusted EBITDA as of the end of the third quarter of this fiscal year was 19.6 million or 6.7% of sales Consolidate return on capital for the trailing 12 month period with 8.7% Now let's take a look at our two at our business segments For mattress fabric segment sales with 33.1 million down 7.4% compared to last year third quarter Operating income for the quarter was 1.8 million compared with 3.2 million a year ago with an operating income margin of 5.4% compared with 9% a year ago The operating performance was primarily affected by lower than expected sales Return on capital for the trailing 12 month period for mattress fabrics was 14.1% For the upholstery fabric segment sales for the third quarter were 35 million down 5.7% over the prior year with prior year was a strong a very strong quarter sales performance that was positively effected by advanced customer purchases in anticipation of additional tariffs Operating income for the quarter was 3 million compared with 3.8 million a year ago with operating income margin of 8.7% compared with 10.2% a year ago We are pleased with the 8.7% margin this year given that it was achieved during the quarter with the Chinese new year shutdown occurred Return on capital for the trailing 12 month period for the upholstery fabric segment continues to be impressive coming in at 54% The home accessory segment which includes our e-commerce and finished product business offering bedding accessories and home goods reported 3.9 million in sales to the third quarter compared with 4.4 million a year ago Operating loss with the quarter was 181,000 which reflects continued sequential improvement from the $350,000 loss experienced in the second quarter and the $535,000 loss experienced in the first quarter We'll comment more on operating performance later on Here are the balance sheet highlights we reported 34.8 million total cash and investment and outstanding barns nine- of 925,000 for a net cash position of 33.9 million For the first nine months of this fiscal year we incurred 4.1 million capital expenditures We returned 4.5 million to shareholders and regular quarter dividends and share repurchases through the third quarter of this fiscal year We had negative cash flow from operations and negative free cash flow of 519,000 and 4.7 million respectively for the first month of this fiscal year due primarily to the timing of payments in advance of Chinese new year set downs and higher than expected inventories mostly in our mattress fabrics business This compared with positive cash flow from operations and positive pre-cash flow of 8.1 million and 5.9 million respectively for the prior year period With better working capital performance including better management of inventory we expect cashflow from operations and free cash flow to improve significantly in the fourth quarter of this fiscal year The company repurchased 56,000 shares of our common stock during the third for this year and repurchased approximately 86,000 additional shares through March 4th Leaving 3.3 million available under the s- previous share repurchase program As reported in our press release our board has approved an increase in our share repurchase authorization back to 5 million Shares may be repurchased at the company's discretion from time to time in the open market or in probably negotiated transactions We will continue to consider opportunities to repurchase shares at a price that reflects a discount to our calculated intrinsic value per share However as highlighted in our capital allocation strategy which is posted in the re- investor relations section of our website we remain focused on a very disciplined approach to capital allocation including maintaining a strong balance sheet and solid cash position particularly given the current uncertainty in the global business environment With that I'll turn the call back over to Iv Thanks Ken Uh let me start with the mattress fabric segment Our mattress fabric sales were lower than anticipated for the third quarter of the year as we were pressured by more than expected or we were pressured more than expected from holiday shutdowns and continued industry weakness for our legacy business customers Mattress covers have become an increasingly important part of our business and losing multiple productive weeks for our class cover operations in Haiti and also in China caused a more significant impact when combined with softness and our legacy business Also the anti-dumping measures relating to low price mattress imports from China have not yet provided the relief expected for the domestic mattress industry In spite of these challenges we continue to manage our business with a relentless focus on creative designs innovative products and exceptional service Our global platform supports these efforts with efficient production and distribution capabilities to provide a full compliment of mattress fabrics and some covers with the flexibility to adapt to evolving customer needs We are strengthened by our existing manufacturing operations in the US Canada Haiti China and our sourcing platform in Turkey We expect to add fabric production capabilities in Vietnam this calendar year and we're also expanding our sewn cover production capabilities in Haiti with a new building and additional equipment We believe these expansions will enhance our abilities to serve customers Further while the domestic disruption from low price mattress imports appears to be continuing as a result of many imports moving from China now to other countries we believe our strong global platform for fabric and covers in Asia has us well-positioned to capture market share with imported mattresses going forward Additionally while the holiday shutdowns disrupted our clients operations in Haiti and China during the third quarter we are pleased with the continued growth of our sewn mattress cover business Demand trends for mattress covers remains favorable especially for the growing box bedding space And we continue to develop fresh products with both new and existing customers With some cover production capabilities now in the US Haiti and Asia we have a very strong platform that allows us to maximize our full supply chain potential from fabric to finished covers We continue to invest in design and marketing capabilities with our latest technologies to improve the customer experience and speed to market with new digital tools and project management software We're very pleased with the initial customer response to our new 3D mapping and rendering capabilities which is being marketed as Re Imagine Culp Home Fashions This reflects the spirit of innovation in our mattress fabrics business We're also enhancing our service platform as part of our ongoing efforts to be more responsive to customer demand with shorter lead times And we are implementing a new inventory management process which we believe will drive greater control I'm especially pleased with Sandy Brown our long time CFO in the mattress fabric segment is now president of the division Having worked with Sandy for over 20 years I'm confident she had the experience expertise and the vision to lead this business as we strive to operate our strong platform in the most efficient manner Looking ahead there are many opportunities to advance our position as a leading provider of mattress fabrics and sewn covers We believe we will benefit from our recent and ongoing efforts to further out design and service capabilities with advanced technologies that support our sales and marketing efforts with both legacy and new customers Now I'll turn to the upholstery fabric segment Our upholstery fabric business was affected by a slow down in shipments heading into the Chinese new year holiday resulting in lower than expected sales for the quarter It's difficult to predict the impact of the holiday shutdown from year to year And this year we experienced a greater than expected decline in January leading up to the holiday period As a result we showed a modest drop in sales compared with a very strong performance in the prior year period In light of the uncertain business environment we faced we are pleased with the overall performance of our upholstery fabric business particularly given the comparison to a very strong quarter last year in fiscal 2019 We have a strong platform in China and stable long-term re- supplier relationships with vendors that prioritize our production due to those strong relationships This has been an important advantage for Culp especially as we res- resumed operations at the end of the third quarter following an extended government mandated shutdown in China associated with the Coronavirus outbreak We believe this platform supports our ability to manage the current disruptions created by this outbreak and the procedures required by the Chinese government Also our addition of cut and sew capabilities in Vietnam for the end of fiscal 2019 has further augmented our Asian platform Throughout fiscal 2020 we have continued to execute our strategic focus of introducing new products and diversifying our customer base We are especially pleased with the continued growth in our hospitality business as we've extended our reach in this growing market Lead window products our window treatment and installation services business has been a key driver of our growing sales in this business And we're excited about the continued growth opportunities as we expand our product portfolio to the hospitality market Product innovation is also a hallmark of our success in the marketplace and provided the state competitive advantage for Culp Our line of highly durable stain resistant LiveSmart fabric con- continues to be very popular with both existing and new customers We are excited about the demand trends for LiveSmart Evolve our recently introduced line of sustainability fabrics featuring the use of recycled yarns along with", "pred_text": "culp third quarter twenty twenty earnings conference call today's call is being recorded at this time for opening

amount of our cotton so production to two facilities we work with in vietnam likewise in both our mattress fabrics and home accessories business we are not currently experiencing any delays in asia and we also have significant alternative locations for production as needed this includes production of sourcing capabilities in the u s canada haiti vietnam and turkey while we cannot predict whether

disruption created by the upbringing now turn to a third quarter results as previously announced i results in the quarter reflected unexpected sales particular in our core business segments while

remainder of fiscal two thousand and twenty and beyond on our turn the call to can who are the financial results for the quarter thank you as mentioned earlier on the call we have posted slide presentations to our investor relations website to cover key performance measures we've also posted our capital allocation strategy here the financial highlights for the third quarter net sales were seventy two million down six point eight percent compared with a prior year period on a pretax gap basis the company reported a net loss of five point one million compare with a pretax income of four point three million for the third quarter of last year as previously disclosed a few weeks ago on february eighteenth the results for the third quarter the current fiscal year include a reversal of a six point one million recorded contingent earn out liability as well as non cash impairment charges of thirteen point six million related to the home assessment division resulted in a non cash net charge of seven million six hundred thousand excluding this net charge adjusted pretax income non gap was two point four million for the third quarter of this fiscal year the financial results for the third quarter of last fiscal year included approximately seven hundred sixty nine thousand in restructuring and related charges and credits and other non recurring items due mostly to the closure of the company's anderson south carolina production facility excluding this net charge pretax income for the third quarter last year was five million net loss attributable the co payholders was fifty eight thousand dollars or zero cents per diluted share for the third quarter compared with a net income of three point two million or twenty five cents per duty share for the prior year period the results of the third quarter of both fiscal years include the respective charges and restructure related credits i just noted the effective income tax rate was nineteen percent for the third quarter and one hundred forty two point eight percent for the year to that period for this fiscal year the company's high effective income tax rate for the interday period reflects a significant decline in the company's projected annual consolidated tax wind come particularly in the u s which includes the income tax effect of the asset impairment charges previously discussed as well as the mix of consolidated tax link come that is earned by the company's foreign operations located in china and canada higher income rates in relation to the u s the current mix of taxable income has led to a significant increase in the effective income tax rate that is associated with our global intangible low tax income or guilty tax which represents a u s income tax on poor earnings importantly income taxes incurred in the us on a cash basis for fiscal two thousand and twenty are expect to be minimal due to the projected utilization of the company's u s federal net operating locker ford and immediate expensing of u s capital expenditures looking ahead to the rest of this fiscal year we estimate that our consolidated effective income tax rate will remain high and be in one hundred and twenty percent one hundred and thirty percent range based on the fact we know today and as affected by the factors noted above notably the u s treasury department and internal revenue service have issued newly proposed regulations that if and when enacted and if enacted as proposed could provide us with some relief from the guilty tax out of the proposed guilty high tax exceptional action beginning of this school two thousand and twenty one early or subject to the timing of enactment and subject to any determination by the u s treasury department and iris that the exception should apply retroactive retroactive the proposed guilty tax high tax exception election is not available to the post regulations are finalized and effective if the proposed guilty tax exception election is an act as proposed and becomes effective for our fiscal two thousand and twenty one year and assuming we do not have non recurring charges or impairments that would reduce our pretense income then based on current assumptions we would estimate our tax rate for fiscal two thousand and twenty one did be in the range of thirty five to fifty percent however let me stress that there are a lot of moving parts that affect this rate including the many factors i've discussed previously so this estimate could change trailing twelve months adjusted even as of the end of the third quarter of this fiscal year with nineteen point six million or six seven percent of sales consolidated return on capital for the troy twelve month period with eight point seven percent now take a look at our two that our business segments for the mattress fabric segment sales were thirty three point one million down seven point four percent compared with last year third quarter operating income for the border was one eight million compared with three two million a year ago with an operating income margin of five four percent compared with nine percent a year ago the operating performance was probably affected by more than expected sales return on capital for the trailing twelve month period for matches fabrics was fourteen point one percent but if both your fabric segment fell for the third quarter thirty five million down five point seven percent over the prior year which prior year was a strong a very strong poor sales performance that was positively affected by advance customer purchases in anticipation of additional tariffs operating income for the quarter was three million compared with three eight million a year ago with operating income margin of eight seven percent compared with ten two percent a year ago we are pleased with the eight seven percent margin this year given that it was achieved during the quarter which the chinese new year shutdown occurred return on capital for the twelve and twelve month period for the post two thousand and seven continues to be impressive coming in at fifty four percent the home assessor segment which includes our e commerce and finished business offering betting assessories and home goods reported three point nine million sales to the third quarter compared with four point four million a year ago operating off of the quarter was one hundred eighty one thousand which reflects continuous sequential prove meant from the three hundred fifty thousand dollar loss experience in the second quarter and the five hundred thirty five thousand dollars loss experience in the first quarter will comment more on operating form it's later on here the balance she highlights we reported thirty four point eight million co cash and investment and outstanding barns nine hundred nine hundred twenty five thousand for a net cash position of thirty three point nine million for the first nine months of this fiscal year we incurred four point one million capital expenditures we returned four point five million to shareholders and regular quarter dividends and sherry purchases through the third quarter this fiscal year we had negative cash flow from operations a negative free cash flow of five hundred ninety thousand and four point seven main respectively for the first month of this fiscal year due primarily to the timing of payments in advance of chinese new year set bands and higher than expected inventory mostly in our matches fabrics business this compared with positive cash flow from operations and positive pre cash flow of eight one million and five nine million respectively for the prior year period with better working capital performance including better management of inventory we expect casco from operations and precast flow to improve significantly in the fourth quarter of this fiscal year the company repurchased fifty six thousand shares or common stock during the third quarter this year and reports approximately eighty six thousand additional shares through march for leaving three point three million battable under the previous share repurchase program as reported in our press release our board has approved an increase our share of purchase authorization back to five million shares may be repurchased at the company's discretion from time to time in the open market or improbably negotiated transactions we will continue to consider attendities to repurchase shares at a price that reflects a discount to our calculated intrinsic value per share however as highlighted in our capital allocation strategy which is posted in the best relations section of our website we remain focused on a very disciplined approach to capital allocation including maintaining a strong balance heat and solid cash position particularly given the current uncertainty in the global business environment with that turn the call back over to it thanks ken let me start with the mattress fabric

chinese new year holiday resulting in lower than expected sales for the quarter it is difficult to predict the impact of the holiday shutdown from year to year and this year we experience a greater than expected decline in january leading up to the holiday period as a result we showed a modest drop in sales compared with a very strong performance in the prior year period in light of the

remain remains uncertain with the health issues surrounding the Coronavirus in China we believe we are well positioned to execute our strategy with favorable results We have a unique combination of innovative products credit design a growing customer base across both residential and hospitality markets and a global platform to support our business and meet changing customer demands As such we remain confident in our ability to deliver another solid performance in our upholstery fabric in fiscal 2020 Lastly I'll comment on the results for Culp home accessories which includes our e-commerce and finished products business offering bedding accessories and home goods We have worked hard to refine our strategy and drive improved results for our home accessory segment While it's taking longer than we expected to reach our initial projection for this business we're encouraged by recent opportunities with new online marketplaces and business to business sales channels We also remain dedicated to improving our performance on Amazon which is a principal sales channel for our legacy e-commerce business In tandem with these strategies we are continuing to develop new products featuring Culp mattress fabrics and upholstery fabrics And we were pleased with a very solid showing up as new products at the recent Las Vegas market We remain optimistic about potential growth opportunities for Culp home accessories and the ability to leverage this new important sales channel to reach new customers for Culp Ken will now review of the outlook for fourth quarter and we'll then take some questions Importantly our expectations for the fourth quarter assumed the Coronavirus outbreak does not have a greater than anticipated impact on the company's operations which may affect each of the company's divisions to varying levels We are monitoring the situation daily and following the processes and procedures provided for in the company's global pandemic disease contingency plan to protect our workforce However the potential impact with the Coronavirus is difficult to estimate reasonably at this point given the solidity and circumstances related to the disease and the actions being taken to contain its spread Subject to those assumptions and limitations we expect the overall sales to decrease slightly compared with the fourth quarter of last year We expect mattress fabric sales to be slightly down compared with the fourth quarter of last year due to continuing market pressure and stock within our legacy business during the fourth quarter while operating income and margins are expected to increase slightly compared with the prior period In our upholstery fabric segment we expect fourth quarter sales and operating income and margins to be slightly higher than the prior year period In our home accessory segment we expect fourth quarter sales to be comparable to the fourth quarter of last fiscal year We expect an operating loss for the fourth quarter but with significant improvement compared to the prior year period and continued quarter report sequential improvement for this fiscal year Considering these factors the company expects report pre-tax income for the fourth quarter in the range of 1.9 million to 2.4 million excluding restructuring and related charges or credits other non-recurring charges and impairment charges if any Pre-tax income for last year's fourth quarter was 1.5 million which included a non-recurring charge of $500,000 Excluding this charge pre-tax income for the fourth quarter of last year was $2 million Based on our current projection capital expenditures for this fiscal year are now expect to be in the 6 million to $6.5 million range depreciation and amortization expect to be approximately 8.6 million Additionally free cash flow for this fiscal year is expected to be moderately down as compared to last year's results With that we went out to take your questions Thank you If you'd like to ask a question please signal by pressing star one on your telephone keypad If you're using a speaker phone please make sure your mute function is turned off to allow your signal to reach our equipment Again press star one to ask a question we'll pause for just a moment to allow everyone an opportunity to signal for questions We'll take our first question from Bobby Griffin with Raymond James please go ahead Good morning everybody thank you for taking my questions Good morning Bobby So I guess the first thing I want to talk about is um product maybe adding some fabric production capabilities in Vietnam And maybe can we expand on on what those capabilities will give you guys And what's the strategy to participate more And what I I guess we can call the Asia import market for mattresses back into the US Right Thank you Bobby This is Iv I'll take that question Um yeah you have to go back a little bit as we think about the anti dumping and tariffs um you know which it feels like you know now we're not even talking about that anymore but that was a pretty significant disruption over the last year the section 301 tariffs the rules for upholstery and mattress fabrics are are quite different So the reason we're looking primarily to establish m- fabric manufacturing in Vietnam is because today mattress fabrics have a fairly significant um extra 301 tariffs coming from China as do mattress covers Um unlike furniture or upholstery fabric where we can ship fabric from China to Vietnam to avoid a tariff unless you make the full sown cover fabric all the way to cover in Vietnam you still you would still pay the extra tariff So for us establishing in Vietnam is uh is a risk management play a cost saving play and certainly gives us the ability to make covers that we can uh fulfill through Vietnam that we can then sell into other countries that are making beds and end up in the US or bring that up in covers of our own back to us in the US What about- Yeah that's very helpful I'm just curious from a competitive standpoint once you get this operation set up would those corresponding covers that you can now make in Vietnam be competitively priced to some of the covers that are already going on imports uh in for the bedroom to the US today Yes sir Bobby we expect you know we've been we've been very competitive with covers already mattress covers that we're making through our Culp China platform uh have been very competitive and there are opportunities materializing there But to be more advantageous to and to deal with US tariff rules and and costs Vietnam could be potentially could potentially more advantageous in certain cases Okay And then second for me on the home accessory business you talked about maybe improving some of the performance on the Amazon channel So can you can you maybe expand a little bit on those strategies And then secondly is there you know a bigger opportunity to sell some of those finished products in in retail locations Uh yes sir Bobby those are really good questions too Um first of all touch on the Amazon part When we first invested in home accessories Amazon was the sole uh really the primarily primary part of the business up to 80% of the sales Uh and we were really focused on that Since the time we've invested it's become more costly to do business and to rank higher to Google ad words to just find yourself higher in the rankings So it ended up costing us more money than we might have expected So we've dialed back our offerings on Amazon to really what we consider our core most stable most cost-effective products And we're trying to do what we consider to be an appropriate level of advertising So what we have placed on Amazon today we believe we can serve as well It's a good quality product that should rank well and that we don't have to over advertise it and and spend too much money to make it work So we're anticipating Amazon being a significant but more like a 50% share of our business and not not such a heavy piece Uh for certain we have great opportunities in all of our accessory products on the B2B side Uh we have a lot of customers uh roll path betting customers that are looking for products to take on and have additional sale accessories We also had a chance to sell some of our products into some retail direct distribution and that is working Um sometimes it's never as fast as we want it to be because it takes time to to get into retail cycle but we are very optimistic about that opportunity also All right I appreciate you taking my questions Iv That was very helpful Best of luck in the next quarter Yes sir Thank you Once again that is star one to ask a question If you find that your question has been answered you may remove yourself from the queue by pressing star two and star one to ask a question We'll take our next question from Paul Betz with Stifel Uh good morning everyone Um continuing with Amazon you mentioned some new sellers are violating uh terms Um can you explain what's going on there and maybe if that gets rectified you know you'll lose some or see less competition Yes sir Well um Paul thank you for the question It's Iv I'll I'll take that too Um basically what's what's happened since we first started with Amazon and there's been a lot of stories in the press about this There have been times where primarily Chinese sellers have uh flooded the marketplace on commodity items um mattress protectors and mattress pads and things that we specialized in And Amazon has pretty specific terms of service the way you the way you acquire a five-star reviews We have a lot of reviews that uh we've earned through steady um normal processes selling items getting reviews It's not really in terms of service to be doing a lot of free giveaways and fabricating reviews and also to be downgrading competitors with fake reviews which we have found um instances of all those things And we have reported them to really high levels in Amazon and and made some headway So Amazon is working really hard to change their method the way they uh rank suppliers And I think in time that will get better but it's a pretty it's a pretty long fight for someone like us to to make a big impact really quick But that's what we mean by terms of service violation It's really fabricated and falsified reviews primarily Okay Thanks And the CapEx was reduced um that just to conserve cash or what areas uh did you might lower that sum Yeah Well this can um yeah we we looked at the year and given our cash position we started prioritizing projects And so you know we have a certain amount of what we call maintenance CapEx which is in that 6 million or so range Uh so um when you look at where we're ending up projected ended up and then looking forward I mean we are going to in this time of uncertainty we are going to prioritize projects And and as we said keep a very close eye on our cash but uh we will continue to invest in the business as as we always have And we'll just have to uh you know just m- mark the things closely and prioritize projects as they come along Okay Thanks And lastly um the of course margins in the mattress segment um will blow our expectations down year over year Is that just the disruption from uh the holiday shutdown or are there anything else going on there No that's that's a good that's a good uh insight there The uh obviously the lower sales uh had an impact but there were a lot of uh moving parts with the shut downs and all that uh in the quarter And uh so that was the the primary reason for the mattresses being down you know the in the lower sales and the other disruption as well Okay Thank you very much Thank you We'll take our next question from Marco Rodriguez of Stonegate Capital Markets please go ahead Uh good morning guys Thank you for taking my questions Wondering if uh Morning Uh I was wondering if maybe you could talk a little bit more about the the expansion activities um that you're doing here in Vietnam and Haiti if you could just maybe place um a a timeline as far as when these capabilities uh will be there and then and then the costs associated with those Yes sir Thanks for the questions Marco Um the expansions in Vietnam and and Haiti um are are both really targeted for the mattress fabrics business in terms of the expansion standpoint We're already operating pretty significantly in Vietnam for our upholstery curtain full kits uh that's performing well Uh Haiti you know we started a a two-pronged strategy a really three pronged strategy for mattress covers You know we have our US business that is a prototyping and quick rollout and emergency recovery platform that works well for us Uh Haiti is a a very low cost opportunity that we see um out on a near sourcing uh potential So we're able to drive uh significantly faster lead times in Haiti It's been a really resounding success for us so far and we're just expanding the building So um it's not a significant expense you know we're just building some extra space and adding some more sewing machines getting into cut and sew so it's not a heavy CapEx uh venture So we would anticipate being in that plan and having additional capacity this summer it's a pretty fast uh pretty fast uh uprising there And we're excited about Haiti The good part about it is we can bring fabrics from anywhere in the world today Um and co- if it's shown in Haiti and comes back to US there's no duty on any of the products in or out So very advantageous platform that should provide us with uh faster lead times If we forecast and store inventory at the right places Uh Vietnam is really an important ability for us to dabble with mattress fabrics in a small way We should we'll start start small mainly focused on serving Asian customers And that's our attempt to get after some of the beds that are being made in Asia And we can do that with both fabric or with a sewn mattress cover Uh if we need to we also have the ability to bring some of that back to the US um not preferred on lead time basis but it could be good for costs Um and we'll just do that on an as-needed basis And we would avoid a section 301 tariff Got it Uh understood And then in terms of the um uh the service platform um uh additions or enhancements that you're taking a look at in the in- in the new inventory management uh can you maybe expand a little bit more on what sort of impact if any you might see on the P and L and or the balance sheet with those Well what and and now I can't now I can't comment on the impact but I'll tell you the way the reason we're thinking about it is the mattress industry always for a long time was a pretty quick speed to market business where we pretty much inventory shipped everything same day and we still do that for a big part of the market But as things have gotten more diverse with imported mattresses and imported components uh lead times have gotten a little longer So we've tried to then match our platform with all the multi countries that were in US Canada China Haiti Vietnam and then our sourcing business in Turkey We want to bring lead times back down even with that global strategy So our anticipation would not be to get out of the longer lead times that we've had recently shorten those lead times down So we're not caught with so much exposure on the water as market conditions change So we're just our intention is to bring a better efficient management of our scheduling um faster lead time to customers to make them happy and then reduce our exposure for extra inventory Yeah Marco this is Ken And that's uh we had you know the extra inventory we we were expecting obviously a better quarter than we had and so we build up inventory that those sales didn't material- uh didn't materialize But now with this new focus uh we should be able to get inventory down and and keep it in line um work consistently which will obviously help improve the cashflow in the fourth quarter But uh we're excited about the new process and uh you know hopefully don't get back in the situation where we build up inventory in expe- in in anticipation sales that that don't materialize So this is this is an exciting move and one that's uh that we're excited uh anxious to get started Got it A- and last quick question I know it's it's kind of a difficult one here on guidance Um you know you you built in some sort of an impact for Coronavirus um but just kind of curious if maybe you can put a little bit more color around what what does worsening conditions mean for you or look like Are are we talking um uh additional shutdowns in China um as far as the risk is conce- concerned And I know that you also brought the fact that um obviously consumer confidence in US is is a big unknown um as it stands right now Yeah Marco I'll I'll I'll answer and then if Boyd wants to jump in Yeah it's it's uh forecasting in this environment and is extremely difficult Um you know w- we we put a lot of um language around the uncertainty um you know as you know everybody reads what happens daily uh the news comes out And so right now we're things are operating uh well in China Uh things have re- are recovering Uh so we've got uh that that news there but um you know things change daily So given where we are we expect uh a good quarter the fourth quarter but uh as as I said things can change quickly and and uh we'll just have to wait and see Now we've got processes and systems that we can react to and and make changes and be flexible in our in our flexible platforms But uh it's just a very very uncertain time right now And so we're just uh being very cautious in how we forecast Boyd I don't know if you wanna- Yeah yeah I'll add to that Ken Thank you And uh Marco just in relation to the current situation for the upholstery side in China um we as we've relayed we've really seen a return now to um mostly normal situations very quickly getting back to normal situations there Uh we had a uh one week delay in our uh China operation um a government mandated one week delay before we were able to get back to operating And then we've seen some delays from our supply base but currently uh nearly all of our suppliers are now back to almost full output again So the current situation is has been very positive Uh we've experienced minimal delays and disruptions to supply to our customer base as a result Um", "pred_text": "performance looking ahead while the business environment rain remains uncertain but the health issues surrounding the coronavirus in china and beyond

sales channel to reach new customers recall can one hour view the outlook for full quarter and move in texas questions importantly our expectations for the fourth quarter assume the crowd of virus outbreak does not have a greater than anticipated impact on the company's operations which may affect each of the companies divisions to varying levels we are monitoring the situation daily and following the processes and procedures provided for in the company's global pandemic disease contingent plan to protect our workforce however the potential impact of the krona virus is difficult to estimate reasonably at this point given the political and circumstances related to the disease and the actions being taken to contain it spread subject to those assumptions and limitations we expect overall sales decrease slightly compared with the fourth quarter of last year we expect matches back to sales to be slightly down compared with the fourth quarter of last year due to continuing market pressure and stock this in our legacy business during the fourth quarter while operating income and margins are expected increase slightly compared with the prior year period in our poster fabric segment we expect fourth quarter sales and operating income in margins to be slightly higher than the prior year period in a home assessories segment we expect fourth quarter sales to be comparable to the fourth quarter of last fiscal year we expect an operating loss for the fourth quarter but with significant improvement compared to the prior year period and continued quarter poor's declinchal improvement for this fiscal year considering these factors the company expects to report pretax income for the fourth quarter in the range of one point nine million to two point four million excluding restructuring unrelated charges or credits other non recurring charges and impairment charges if any pretax income for last year's fourth quarter was one point five million which included a non recurring charge of five hundred thousand dollars excluding this charge pretax income for the fourth quarter of last year was two million dollars based on our current projection capital expenditures for this fiscal year are now expect to be in the six million to six million five hundred thousand dollars range depreciation amortization expect to be approximately eight six million additionally recast though for this fiscal year is expected in moderately down as compared to last year's results with that we will now take your questions thank you if you'd like to ask a question please signal by pressing star one on your telephone keypad if you're using a speaker phone please make sure your main function is turned off to allow your signal to reach our equipment again press star one to ask a question will pause for just a moment to allow everyone an opportunity to signal for questions we'll take our first question from bobby griffin with raymond james please go ahead morning body thank you for taking my questions so i guess the person want to talk about maybe having fabric production capabilities in vietnam maybe can we expand on on what those capabilities are given what's the strategy to participate more and what i guess we can call the asia import market for mattresses back into the u s right thank you bobby this is about take that question you have to go back a little bit as we think about both antidumping and tariffs you know which appeals like you know now we're not even talking about that anymore but pretty significant disruption over the last year of section three hundred and one tariffs the rules for upholstery and mattress that are quite different so the reason we're looking primarily to establish fabric manufacturing in vietnam is because today mattress fabrics have a fairly significant extra three hundred and one tariff coming from china as do mattress covers unlike furniture or upholstery fabric where we can ship fabric from china to vietnam to avoid a tariff unless you make the full sun cover fabric all the way to cover in vietnam you still pay the extra tariff so for us establishing in vietnam is a risk management play a cost saving play and certainly gives us ability to make covers that we can fill through vietnam that we can sell into other countries that are making bad end up in the u s or bring that in covers of our own back to us in the u s will that answer yeah that's very helpful i'm just curious from a competitive standpoint once you get this operation set up with those corresponding covers that you can now make in vietnam be competitively price to some of the covers that are already going on and ports imported beds into the u s today yes sir bobby respect you we've done we've been very competitive with covers already mattress covers that we're making through our cult china platform has been very competitive and there are already opportunities materializing there but to be more advantageous and to deal with u s tariff rules and costs vietnam could be potentially potentially more advantageous in certain cases ok and secondly for me on the home assessor business you talked about maybe improving some of the performance on the amazon channel so we can maybe expand a little bit on those strategies and then secondly is there you know bigger opportunity to sell some of those finished products and retail locations yes sir bobby those are really good questions to first i'll touch on the amazon part when we first invested in home accessories amazon was the sole really the primarily primary part of the business up to eighty percent of the sales and we were really focused on that since the time we've invested has become more costly to do business and to rank higher to google ad words to just find yourself higher in the rankings of costness more money than we might have expected so we've dow back our offerings on amazon to really what we consider our core most stable most cost effective products and we're trying to do what we consider to be an appropriate level of advertising so what we have on amazon today we believe we can service well it's a good quality product that should rank well and then we don't have to over advertise it and and spend too much money to make it work so we're anticipating amazon be on a significant but more like a fifty percent share of our business and not not such a heavy piece for certain we have great opportunities in all of our accessory products on the b to b side we have a lot of customers betting customers that are looking for products to tack on and have additional sales accessories we also have a chance to sell some of our products into some retail direct distribution and that is working sometimes it's never as fast as we wanted to be because it takes time to get in the retail cycle but we are very optimistic about that opportunity also appreciate you took my question very helpful lucky the next order yes sir thank you once again that is star want to ask a question if you find that your question has been answered you may remove yourself from the queue by pressing star to star want to ask a question we'll take our next question from paul betts with steve good morning everyone continuing with amazon you mentioned some new sellers are filing terms playing what's going on there maybe that gets rectified lose and there are seen less competition yes sir well thank you for the question and i'll take that to basically what's what's happened since we first started with amazon and there's been a lot of stories in the press about this there have been times where primarily chinese sellers have flooded the marketplace on commodity items mattress protectors and mattress pads and things that we specialized in and amazon has pretty specific terms of service the way you the way you acquire fast our reviews we have a lot of reviews that we've earned through steady normal processes selling items getting reviews it's not really in terms of service to be doing a lot of free giveaways and fabricating reviews and also to be downgrading competitors with fake reviews which we have found instances of all those things and we have reported on to really high levels in amazon and made some headway so amazon is working really hard to change their method the way they rank suppliers and i think in time that will get better but it's a pretty it's a pretty long fight for someone like us to make a big impact really quick but that's what we mean by terms of service violation is really fabricated and falsified reviews primarily ok thanks the cap tax was reduced just to conserve cash or what areas did you might lower that we we looked at the year and given our cash position we started prioritizing projects and so you know we have a certain amount of what we call maintenance cap x which is in that six million or so range so when you look at where we're in the enough projected end up and then looking forward i mean we are going to in this time of uncertainty we are going to projects and as we said keep a very close eye on our cash but we will continue to invest in the business as we always have and we'll just have to you know just mark the things closely and prioritize projects as they come along ok thanks and lastly gross margins in the mattress segment lower expectations down year of year is that just the disruption from the holiday shutdown or anything else going on there now that that's a good that's a good insight there the obviously the lower sales had an impact but there were a lot of moving parts with the shutdowns and all that in the quarter and so that was the primary reason for the margin being down you know that you have the lower sales and the other disruption as well ok thank you very much thank you we'll take our next question from marco rodriguez to stonegate capital markets please go ahead good morning guys thank you for taking my questions wondering morning i was wondering if maybe you could talk a little bit more about the expansion activities that you're doing here in vietnam in haiti if you just maybe a place a timeline as far as when these capabilities will be there and then and then the costs associated with those yes sir thanks for the questions darco and expansions in vietnam and haiti are both really targeted for the mattress fabrics business in terms of the expansion standpoint we're already operating pretty significantly in vietnam for our whole street cut and so kits that's performing well haiti you know sort of a two prong strategy really three prong strategy for mattress covers you know we have our u s business that is a prototyping and quick rollout an emergency recovery platform that works well for us haiti is a very low cost opportunity that we see often a near sourcing potential so we're able to drive significantly faster lead times in haiti it's been a really resounding success for so far and we're just expanding the

for a long time was a pretty quick speed to market business where we pretty much inventoried shipped everything same day and we still do that for a big part of the market but if things have gotten more diverse with imported mattresses and imported components only times of gotten a longer so we've tried to match our platform with all the multi countries that were in u s canada china haiti vietnam in our sourcing business in turkey we want to bring lead times back down even with that global strategy so our anticipation would not be to get out of the longer lead time so we've had recently shorten those lead times down so we're not caught with so much exposure on the water as market conditions change so we're just our intention is to bring a better efficient management of our scheduling faster return to customers to make them happy and then reduce our exposure for extra and tory yeah marco this can and that we had you know the extra inventory we we were expecting obviously a better poor than we had so we built up him and tory that those cells didn't material didn't materialize but now with this new focus we should be able to get him a tory down and keep it in line work consistently which will obviously help improve the cash flow in the fourth quarter but we're excited about the new process and you know hopefully don't get back in a situation where we build up inventory inexpensive in anticipation sales that don't materialize so this is this is exciting move in one that that works anxious to get started and last quick question it's kind of a difficult one here on guidance you know you built in some sort of an impact for chronovirus but just kind of curious that maybe you can put a little bit more color around what what does worsening conditions mean for you or look like are we talking additional shutdowns in china as far as the risk is concerned and i know that you also brought the fact that obviously consumer confidence in us is a big unknown as it stands right now yeah marko i'll answer and then a board wants to jump in yeah it's it's forecasting in this environment and is extremely difficult you know we put a lot of language around the uncertainty you know as you know everybody reads what happens daily the news comes out and so right now we are things are operating well in china things have recovering so we've got that that news

seen a return now to mostly normal situations very quickly getting back to normal situations there we had a one week delay in our china operation a government mandated one week delay before we were able to get back to operating and then we seemed delays from our supply base but currently nearly all of our suppliers are now back to almost full output again so the current situation is been very

Conference Call My name's Brandon and I'll be your operator for today At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode Later we will conduct a question and answer session during which you can dial star-one if you have a question Please note this conference is being recorded and I will now turn it over to Steve Whitaker Vice President of Investor Communications You may begin sir Thanks Brandon Good morning and welcome to GE's first quarter 2020 Earnings Call I'm joined by our chairman and CEO Larry Culp and CFO Carolina Dybeck Happe Before we start I'd like to remind you that the press release and presentation are available on our website Note that some of the statements we're making are forward looking and are based on our best view of the world and our businesses as we see them today As described in our SCC filings and on our website those elements can change as the world changes With that I'll hand the call over to Larry Steve thanks Good morning everyone We hope you and your families are healthy and safe our thoughts are with all of those affected this global pandemic We recognize this is a very difficult and challenging time for everyone On behalf of GE I want to express our gratitude to those on the front lines in the medical community many of whom we're privileged to call our customers working tirelessly to protect all of us Thank you When we last spoke during our outlook Call in March we were encouraged by the continued strength and aviation in healthcare and the progress made in power renewables In the eight week since the world has fundamentally changed As we all know the COVID-19 pandemic evolved rapidly hitting hard and hitting fast While this is an earnings call our goal today is to provide you with the most current and relevant information we have and as always to be as open and transparent as we possibly can So forgive us if we run a little long today The COVID-19 dynamics at GE like the economy at large are fluid and still evolving but clearly challenging in the near term With that I'll start with our response to COVID-19 Carolina who is joining our Earnings Call for the first time will cover the financials Then I'll wrap with a more in-depth view of our current operations Moving to slide two during this unprecedented time we'll focus on three areas First the health and safety of our employees and our communities We established a COVID-19 taskforce that are working to ensure we're doing everything in our ability to protect the health and safety and aligning with the various government directives and medical advisories in real time To that end we've encouraged those employees who are not directly performing customer-facing essential jobs to work from home wherever possible But given the mission critical work we do at GE not everyone can stay home I'd like to acknowledge our employees out in the field and in our factories for their unwavering dedication as they continue to deliver for our customers supporting essential services like hospitals power generation airlines and national defense We're ensuring they have what they need to do their job safely This includes temperature screenings face coverings and gloves as necessary and physical distancing all keeping with national state and local guidelines I'm also inspired by the support that our employees have shown each other We recently established an employee relief fund and more than 75 senior leaders across GE have contributed portions of their salary to support those affected by this crisis Our second priority is continuing to serve our customers In healthcare we're ramping production of critical medical equipment used to diagnose and treat COVID-19 patients including respiratory CT monitoring solutions x-ray anesthesia and point of care ultrasound product lines Already our team has doubled production of ventilators and plans to double again by the end of June Healthcare's digital and AI solutions are helping hospitals remotely monitor multiple patients at once and automate road tasks so clinicians can spend more of their precious time focused on life-saving work Across all of our businesses we're in constant communication with employees customers suppliers and governments to maintain business continuity without disruption Our third priority is preserving our strength First and foremost sound liquidity is crucial and solidifying our balance sheet remains a key focus With the recent closing of the BioPharma transaction we received $20 billion of net proceeds This provides GE with optionality t-to protect our company and remain flexible And importantly we retained a $17 billion leading healthcare business at the center of an ecosystem striving for precision health Preserving our strength in a time like this also requires a different operating model Here I draw on my experiences as CEO managing through nine eleven and the global financial crisis There are three steps in this model embrace reality redefine winning and execute the plan Easy to say hard to do Starting with embrace reality this is necessary in a time like this When so much has changed and remains uncertain For us it means recognizing that we're facing significant headwinds in aviation and we may be for awhile We wish it were otherwise but that's not our reality Next redefine winning We came into 2020 with a plan to define winning as profitable growth margin expansion and cash generation Now we need to adjust to the altered environment to focus and inspire our team Let me share some ways we're doing this While safety has always been a top priority for GE COVID-19 has reshaped our safety agenda In terms of our financial priorities improving our cash generation and decremental margins in the second half are key focus areas And in healthcare we clearly didn't come into the year expecting to increase our ventilator production fourfold but we will And finally execute the plan We're moving with speed discipline and intensity to improve our cost structure It's already more than two billion of cost actions and more than three billion of cash actions And this is where lean is particularly relevant from daily management to traditional Kanban systems which help reset inventory levels to do problem solving tools we're rolling out across GE Let me share a recent example from Gas Power In our Greenville facility the team use lean to cut the distance that a single part travels during production from three miles yes three miles to a mere 165 feet slashing the time it took to make that part by 42% These are the sort of operational efficiencies that are more essential than ever in this environment So that's our approach here We're facing the pandemic head-on while continuing to execute our longterm strategy for GE Moving to slide three you'll find a snapshot of our first quarter results And Carolina will take you through this in detail but first a few top line thoughts As I noted we entered the year with momentum however as COVID-19 continued to spread globally and I'm not going to sugar coat this we got hit hard in some of our highest margin parts of our best performing businesses This is especially true at aviation services where COVID-19 costs are rapid decline in commercial aviation demand and even essential travel became difficult in the second half of March A similar situation also transpired at power services where travel restrictions caused by COVID-19 impacted our field personnel And across all of our businesses we started to see some project fulfillment and execution issues At the same time healthcare performed well due to urgent demand for our products used in the fight against COVID-19 Taking a step back about 80% of our roughly $100 billion backlog is in services which have a long time horizon And while services have been hurt in the near term those capabilities remain one of our greatest strengths They keep us close to our customers with deep strategic relationships especially through periods of volatility So in the spirit embracing reality let me frame for you what we're seeing right now at a high level and then I'll do a deeper dive after Carolina reviews the first quarter In aviation and at GECAS airlines are conserving cash not flying the planes they have limiting maintenance spare spend where they can and all the while deferring orders in many places no one can predict when and how leisure and business travel will resume but the reality is likely it's not soon So we're redefining winning For margin expansion in 2020 to improving our detrimental margins this year which re- requires we aggressively adjust our cost structure That's what winning looks like for aviation and they're moving forward with a comprehensive plan To be clear we'll get back to targeting those 20% operating margins post pandemic In healthcare we've been on the front line combating COVID-19 since the early days in Wuhan This is fundamental to our mission While we've seen demand surge for certain products other products including those in our high margin pharmaceutical diagnostics business have been negatively impacted as multiple procedures are deferred Healthcare is likely to rebound faster than aviation but we're still fast tracking additional cost out actions targeting an incremental $700 million since Kieran and the team spoke with you in December In power and renewable energy the impact of COVID-19 has been more limited to date Specifically at power we're experiencing outage delays and restrictions and field service travel and we're monitoring new unit orders and services To offset this we're further rightSizing the cost structure and in power we already reduce head count by 700 in the first quarter Now clearly across GE there are a number of large variables that are unknown at this point including the full duration magnitude and pace of rec- recovery across our end markets operations and supply chains We're also monitoring how the resulting interest rate environment will impact pension obligations and our run-off insurance business So let me tell you what we do know The second quarter will be the first full quarter with pressure from COVID-19 and we expect that our financial results will decline sequentially before they improve later this year The bottom line is we have some challenging times ahead but this too shall pass I'm confident the underlying reset we took over the last 18 months to focus GE's portfolio and instill a greater focus on customers and lean give us a running start for what we face today Moreover I see in our response to COVID-19 signs of how we're moving faster to change GE for the good more lean work to help reduce inventories in the face of demand challenges in aviation Travel restrictions spurring on the use of remote digital technology to complete field work and renewables and more capital discipline across the board With new leaders assimilating faster and with real impact healthcare comes to mind So all of this in combination with the planned actions we'll discuss later are accelerating our transformation of GE With that I'll turn it over to Carolina but before I do let me say how pleased I am to have her on board In two short months it's clear we share the same perspectives of embracing reality and operational bias for action and executing with speed Thank you Larry I'm proud to join my first call as CFO of GE and help lead this company forward As you're noted we're operating in unprecedented times and we're focused on first keeping our financial position strong and safe with a keen eye on leverage and liquidity as well as cashflow and capital discipline While GE's actions over the last couple of years have put us on a stronger footing ahead of this situation we will do more Second working with our businesses to take the right action Not only to help mitigate the impact of COVID-19 but to serve customers better operate smarter and more efficiently and integrated lean more holistically While Larry and I are focused on the near term we're also managing for the long term We're working together to reduce complexity at GE adding a lean culture that delivers sustainable earnings and cashflow generation Today my intention is to take you through our results in detail and provide context that help you see what I see across the businesses With that let's turn to slide four This was a challenging quarter for us as the macro environment rapidly deteriorated Taking it from the top first quarter orders were down 3% organically or down four ex BioPharma Growth in power and healthcare was effect by double digit decline in aviation and renewables Both equipment and service orders were down below single digit I'll cover this by business shortly Industrial revenue was down 5% organically or down six ex bio pharma is equipment revenue flat and services down 9% Both aviation and power services were adversely impacted in the quarter due to COVID-19 Adjusted industrial profit margins were down 450 basis points organically Most of the came from aviation or renewable with aviation impact mostly driven by COVID-19 Now Let's discuss Starting at continuing ETF of 0.72 cents There was a 0.75 cents gain primarily related to the 11.5 billion after tax gain can from the BioPharma side which also included one cent of tax benefit in GE capital This was partially affect by a 4.6 billion after tax loss on our remaining Baker Hughes which will measure at fair value each quarter On restructuring and other items we incurred 2 cents of charges Is this principally related to the reduction of aviation's US workforce Lastly non-operating pension and other benefit plans were 6 cents headwind in the quarter Excluding this item adjusted tax was 5 cents As described earlier our earnings performance was materially impacted by COVID-19 and other market dynamics This was primarily in aviation and GE capital line with negative marks and impairment in both GECAS and insurance as well as higher credit costs We estimates the first quarter industrial operating profit impact from COVID-19 roughly 700 million Drivers included lower aftermarket sales project delays and supply chain constraints This impact is higher than anticipated at the March outlook call reflecting the rapid global progression of the pandemic But our prior forecast largely reflected the slowdown in China Our focus on addressing this pandemic is global we're targeting more than two billion of cost out this year while this may not affect the full impact we're rapidly addressing both costs and cash to making our businesses more agile and customer focused over time I can tell you from my experience that as this program builds momentum and the company leaders begin to see how powerful results can be they tend to extend beyond their stated goals With just what I've seen so far I'm encouraged that we can have some of that same experience at GE Moving to cash As many of you know the first quarter is typically low for our free cashflow This year we're impacted by our usual seasonality but also COVID-19 especially in aviation Industrial free cashflow flow was use of 2.2 billion one billion worse than prior year That's notably excluding aviation each industrial business improved free cashflow versus last year Turning to the key drivers in the quarter Starting with net earnings If you exclude the bio pharma and the mark to market on our Baker Hughes investment income depreciation and amortization total 700 million That's down 900 million versus prior year Next working capital negative 2.6 billion asa significant use of cash down 1.1 billion Let me take you through the main factors First we had the net inflow in accounts receivable driven by seasonally lower volume in gas power and renewables Second we had an outflow in accounts payable driven by lower volume in aviation and higher disbursements related to primary end material buys in renewables Third the increased inventory to support an expected second and third quarter volume run in onshore wind and shop output declined aviation Fourth progress collections There were a use of cash as new orders and milestone payments were more than effect by burndown of prior progress payments in power and renewables Lastly we also spent about 600 million in gross CapEx We're on track now to reduce 25% of our CapEx spend this year For cashflow in total we estimate the first quarter impact from COVID-19 of around one billion The majority of which was health and aviation As we look forward we expect continued free cashflow pressure retargeting more than three billion in cash action However over time we know that each business can be a better cash generator as we improve execution Moving to slide six we continue to strengthen our balance sheet Largest in the quarter was closing bio pharma The 20 billion We ended the quarter with 33.8 billion of industrial cash up approximately 16 billion sequentially GE capital and with the 13.5 billion of cash down approximately 5.3 billion sequentially driven by contractual maturity We continue to hold a liquidity balance covering 12 months of GE debt maturity The risk that we take in action to enhance and expand our liquidity and pay down debt On April 17 GE entered into a three year 15 billion syndicated revolving credit facility This was the planned refinancing of GE's prior 20 billion syndicated revolver credit facility including bilateral agreements we expect to have in the range of 20 billion in total credit line access going forward Following the sale of bio pharma we also improved our liquidity profile in April We reduced our near term debt maturities by issuing six billion in GE debt in April and subsequently tendering for 4.2 billion of debt The plan to use the remaining 1.8 billion of proceeds to further debt reduction and the combination of transaction will therefore be leverage neutral Following this GE Cap GE", "pred_text": "the first quarter twenty twenty general electric company earnings conference call my name's brandon i'll be your operator for today at this time all participants are in a listen only mode later we will conduct a question and answer session during which you can tell star one if you have a question please note this conference is being recorded and i will not turn it over to steve winniker vice president of investor communications begins or thanks brandon good morning and welcome to g e first quarter two thousand and twenty earnings call joined by our chairman it's the e o larry culp and c f o carolina kapa before we start i'd like to remind you that the press release and presentation are available on our website note that some of the statements we're making are forward looking and are based on our best view of the world and our businesses as we see them today as described in our f c c filings and on our website those elements can change if the world changes with that i'll hand the call over to larry steve thanks good morning everyone we hope you and your families are healthy and safe our thoughts are with all of those affected by this global pandemic we recognize this is a very difficult and challenging time for everyone on behalf of g e i want to express our gratitude to those on the front lines in the medical community many of whom were privileged to call our customers working tirelessly to protect all of us thank you when we last spoke during our outlook call in march we were encouraged by the continued strength in aviation and health care and the progress made in power renewables in the eight week sense the world has fundamentally changed as we all know the covent one thousand pandemic evolved rapidly hitting hard and hitting fast while this is an earnings call our goal today is to provide you with the most current and relevant information we have and as always to be as open and transparent as we possibly can so forgive us if we run a little long today the coba one thousand dynamics at g e like the economy at large are fluid and still evolving but clearly challenging in the near term with that i'll start with our response to coben nineteen carolina who is joining our earnings call for the first time will cover the financials then i'll wrap with a more in depth view of our current operations moving to slide two during this unprecedented time we're focused on three areas first the health and safety of our employees in our communities we established a cobin one thousand task force that is working to ensure we're doing everything in our ability to protect the health and safety and aligning with various government directives and medical advisories in real time to that end we've encouraged those employees who are not directly performing customer basing essential jobs to work from home wherever possible but given the mission critical work we do a g e not everyone can stay home i'd like to acknowledge our employees out in the field and in our factories for their unwavering dedication as they continue to deliver for our customers supporting essential services like hospitals power generation airlines and national defense we're ensuring they have what they need to do their job safely this includes temperature screenings base coverings and gloves as necessary and physical distancing all keeping with national state and local guidelines i'm also inspired by the support that our employees have shown each other we recently established an employee relief fund and more than seventy five senior leaders across g e have contributed portions of their salary to support those affected by this crisis our second priority is continuing to serve our customers in health care we're ramping production of critical medical equipment used to diagnose and treat code one thousand patients including respiratory c t monitoring solutions x ray anesthesia and point of care ultrasound product lines already our team has double production of ventilators and plans to double again by the end of june health care is digital and ai solutions are helping hospitals remotely monitor multiple patients at once and automate rote tasks so clinicians can spend more of their precious time focused on lifesaving work across all of our businesses were in constant communication with employees customers suppliers and governments to maintain business continuity without disruption our third priority is preserving our strength first and foremost sound liquidity is crucial and solidifying our balance sheet remains a key focus with the recent closing of the bio pharma transaction we received twenty dollars billion of net proceeds this provides g e with optionality to protect our company and remain flexible and importantly we retained a seventeen dollars billion leading health care business at the center of an ecosystem striving for precision help preserving our strength in a time like this also requires a different operating model here i draw my experience as a ceo managing through nine eleven and the global financial crisis there are three steps in this model embrace reality redefine winning and execute the plan easy to say hard to do starting with embrace reality this is necessary in a time like this when so much has changed and remains uncertain for us it means recognizing that we're facing significant headwinds in aviation and we may be for a while we wish it were otherwise but that's not our reality next redefine winning we came into two thousand and twenty with a plan to define winning as profitable growth margin expansion and cash generation now we need to adjust to the altered environment to focus and inspire our team let me share some ways we're doing this while safety has always been a top priority for g e coven nineteen has reshaped our safety agenda in terms of our financial priorities including our cash generation and decremator margins in the second half are key focus areas and health care we clearly didn't come into the year expecting to increase our ventilator production or cold but we will and finally execute the plan we're moving with speed discipline and intensity to improve our cost structure tardy more than two billion of cost actions and more than three billion of cash actions and this is where lead is particularly relevant from daily management to traditional combine systems which help reset inventory levels to do problem solving tools rolling out across ge let me share a recent example from gas power in our greenville facility the team used lean to cut the distance that a single part travels during production from three miles yes three miles to a mere one hundred and sixty five feet flashing the time it took to make that part by forty two percent these are the sort of operational efficiencies that are more essential than ever in this environment so that's our approach here we're facing the pandemic head on walk in tinuing to execute our long term strategy for g e moving to slide three you'll find a snapshot of our first quarter results and carolina will take you through this in detail but first a few top line thoughts as i noted we entered the year with momentum however as coban one thousand continued to spread globally and i'm not going to sugarcoat that we got hit hard in some of our highest margin parts of our best performing businesses this is especially true at aviation services where coban nineteen cost a rapid decline in commercial aviation demand and even essential travel became difficult in the second half of march a similar situation also transpired at power services where travel restrictions caused by kova nineteen impacted our field personnel and across all of our businesses we started to see some project film it and execution issues at the same time health care perform well due to urgent demand for our products used in the fight against copa nineteen taking a step back about eighty percent of our roughly four hundred dollars billion backlog is in services which have a long time horizon and while services have been hurt in the near term those capabilities remain one of our greatest strengths they keep us close to our customers with deep strategic relationships especially through periods of volatility so in the spirit of embracing reality let me frame for you what we're seeing right now at a high level and then i'll do a deeper dive after carolina reviews the first quarter in aviation energy cas airlines are conserving cash not flying the planes they have limiting maintenance they are spend where they can and all the while the firing orders in many places no one can predict when and how leisure business travel will resume but the reality is likely it's not soon so we're redefining winning margin expansion in two thousand and twenty to improving our decremenal margins this year requires we aggressively adjust our cost structure that's what when he looks like ravi ation and they're moving forward with a comprehensive plan to be clear we'll get back to targeting those twenty percent operating margins post pandemic and health care we've been on the front lines combating cobbler nineteen since the early days and this is fundamental to our mission while we've seen demand surge for certain products other products including those in our high margin pharmaceutical diagnostics business have been negatively impacted as multiple procedures are deferred health care is likely to rebound faster than aviation but we're still fast tracking additional cost out actions targeting an incremental seven hundred dollars million since karen and the team spoke with you in december and power and renewable energy the impact of coba nineteen has been more limited to date specifically at power we're experiencing outage delays and restrictions in field service travel and we're monitoring new unit orders and services to offset this we're further right sizing the cost structure and empower we already reduced headcount by seven hundred in the first quarter now clearly across the there are a number of large variables that are unknown at this point including the full duration magnitude and pace of recovery across our end markets operations and supply chains we're also monitoring how the resulting interest rate environment will impact pension obligations and our runoff insurance business so let me tell you what we do know the second quarter will be the first full quarter with pressure from coban nineteen and we expect that our financial results will decline sequentially before they improve later this year the bottom line is we have some challenging times ahead but this too shall pass i'm confident the underlying reset we took over the last eighteen months to focus g e s portfolio and instill a greater focus on customers and lead give us a running start for what we face today moreover i see in our response to coban one thousand signs of how we're moving faster to change she eat for the good more lean work to help reduce inventories in the face of demand challenges in aviation travel restrictions spring on the use of remote digital technology to complete build work in renewables and more capital discipline across the board with new leaders assimilating faster and with real impact health care comes to mind so all of this in combination with the planned actions we'll discuss later are accelerating our transformation of g e with that i'll turn it over to carolina but before i do let me say how pleased i am to have her on board and two short months it's clear we share the same perspectives of embracing reality and operational bias reaction and executing the speed thank you larry i'm proud to join my first call as to the and help move this company until forward as you noted we're operating in unprecedented times focused on first keeping our financial position strong and with a keen eye on leverage on liquidity as well as cash go and capital discipline bunch of actions over the last couple of years have put us on stronger footing ahead of the situation we will do more second working with our businesses to take the right action not only to help mitigate the impact of covid nineteen but to serve customers better operate smarter and more efficiently and integrate loot more holistically by larry and i are focused on the near term also managing for the long term we're working together to reduce complexity that deliver sustainable earning and cash for generation today my intention is to take me through a result in detail and provide context that help you see what i see across the business with that that's going to slide for this was a challenging quarter for us as the macro rapidly deteriorated taking it from the top first quarter orders were down three percent organically or down for growth in power and health care was offset by double digit declines in aviation and renewable both equipment and service orders were down low single digit i'll cover this by business shortly industrial revenue down five percent organically well down six expio pharma with equipment revenue flat and services down nine percent both aviation and power services were adversely impacted in the quarter due to covid nineteen adjusted industrial profit margins were down four hundred fifty points organically most of the dilution came from aviation i renewables with aviation impact mostly driven by covid nineteen s what starting a continuing of seventy two cents it was a seventy five cents gain primarily related to the eleven billion from the bio from a fine which also included one cent of tax benefit in capital this was partially affect by a four point six billion off the tax loss on our remaining baker huge stake which will measure x our value on the structuring and other items we incurred two cents of charges this is principally related to the reduction of aviation to us workforce softly non operating pension and other benefits were six cent had within the quarter excluding this item adjusted if described earnings performance was materially impacted by covid nineteen and other market dynamics it was primarily aviation and you kept negative marks and impairment in both and insurance as well as higher credit costs the estimate the first quarter industrial operating profit impact from cobin roughly seven hundred million private included lower off to market project and supply chain constraints this impact is higher than anticipated at the march outlaw affecting the rapid global progression of the pandemic but our prior forecasts largely reflected the slowdown in china i will focus on addressing this pandemic is global we're targeting more than two billion of cost out this year but this may not affect the full impact we're rapidly addressing both cost and cash and making our businesses more customer focused over time i can tell you from my experience that this program builds momentum and the company leaders begin to see how powerful results can be they tend to extend beyond their stated goals just what i have been so far i'm encouraged that we can have some of that experience moving to cash as many of you know the first quarter is typically low for our free cash flow this year we're impacted by our usual personality but also covid nineteen especially in aviation industrial free cash bill with a use of two point two billion one billion worse than prior year but notably excluding aviation each industrial business improved free cash flow this was lost turning to the key drivers in the quarter starting with net if you exclude by a farm again and the mark to market now because income depreciation and mortgage total seven hundred million that's down nine hundred million versus prior year next working capital negative two point six billion with a significant use of cash down one point one billion let me take it through the main factors first we had a net info in the counter driven by lower volume in gas power and renewables second we had an outflow in account driven by a lower volume in aviation and higher disbursements related to private material by newt increase inventory to support an expected second and third quarter volume round in onshore wind and shop output declined innovation for progress connections they were a use of cash new orders and milestone payments were more than affect by burn down of prior progress payments in power and renewables we also spent about six hundred million in gross capacity on track now to reduce twenty five percent of our cap expend for cash go in total we estimate the first quarter impact from covid nineteen was around one billion the majority of which was held in aviation as we look forward we expect continued free cash flow pressure targeting more than three billion in cash auction however over time we know that each business can be a better cash generator as we improve execution moving to slide six we continue to strengthen our balance largest milestone in the quarter was killing by a farmer twenty billion of we ended the quarter with thirty three point eight billion of industrial cash up approximately sixteen billion sequentially capital ended with thirteen point five billion of cash approximately five point three billion sequentially even by contractual maturities because you to hold a liquidity balance covering twelve months of the maturities the recently taken action to enhance and extend our liquidity and pay down april seventeen entered into a three year fifteen billion syndicated revolving credit facility this was a planned refinancing of jews prior twenty billion syndicated revolver credit facility including bilateral agreements we expect to have in the range of twenty billion in total credit line access going forward following the sale of by a farmer we also improved our liquidity profile in april we reduced our new york term death maturity issuing six billion into that in april and subsequently tendering for four point two billion of that plan to use the remaining one point eight billion of proceeds to further debt production and the combination of transaction will therefore be leverage neutral following this industrial has", "wer": 0.2552980132450331,

we'll discuss industrial segments results Starting with aviation As you've noted our first quarter results were materially impacted Orders are down 13% organically with both equipment and service orders down Equipment orders were down 27% primarily driven by commercial NGS business due to the max grounding and the COVID impact Services orders were down 4% primarily driven by commercial services partially offset by military uh which one you fighter helicopter service orders from the US DOD Service orders were stronger than revenues due to the military orders which were up 60% year over year Backlog of 273 billion was flat sequentially and up 22% versus prior year primarily driven by long-term service agreement This included roughly 200 one day unit order cancellations in the quarter Revenue was down 11% organically equipment revenue was down 17% We shipped 472 commercial installed and spare engine units this quarter down 37 versus prior year Sale of 272 1A and 1B units were down 152 and CFM 56 units were down 98 units Service revenue was down 8% due to commercial services down 11% This was driven by lower spare part shipments and lower shop visits from the impact of COVID-19 Total military revenue was down 7% with 146 engine unit shipments down 9% And this was driven by supply chain fulfillment dynamics and inbound material is partly offset by the enhanced programs gross Operating profit was down 39% organically primarily on lower volume and negative mix pressure in commercial services from the impact of COVID-19 and low spare engin units Segment margin contracted 650 basis points organically this was primarily due to COVID-19 impacting our commercial businesses in both engines and services The continued 737 max grounding the non-repeat of prior year favorable contract adjustment and the first full quarter of revenues from our aero derivative business now that we have de consolidated big issues Add a bit more color COVID-19 represents just over half of the year over year margin difference 773 seven max timing considering install and spare engine volumes and supply chain exact costs represent additional 20% of the world Moving to healthcare which performed well Orders were up 9% organically equipment orders put up 40% and up one Healthcare order excluding were up 6% driven by a surge demand related to COVID-19 This was partially offset by delays in procurement and lower demand of products less related to COVID-19 Examples like MR and intervention in healthcare systems as well as contracting their uh nuclear tracers in uh pharmaceutical diagnostics Life sciences orders were up 10% Backlog was 17.4 billion down 6% sequentially and down three versus prior year due to the sale of marijuana So excluding Biopharma battler was up 1% sequentially and four versus prior year Revenue was up 2% organically and 1% excluding Biopharma Healthcare systems revenue was up 2% with services and 3% with uh equipment flat Life sciences was up 4% Operating profit was up 10% organically segment margin expanded 140 basis points organically or 30 basis points excluding Biopharma This was driven by volume and cost productivity offset by price and logistics pressures from COVID-19 Next on power we had mixed results with equipment top-line strength offset by challenges in services Orders were up 14% organically Gas power orders were up 8% with equipment orders up 37% largely due to one turnkey order You booked 2.2 gigawatt of orders for nine gas turbines Gas power service orders were down 3% with contractual services down and transactional upgrades roughly flat Power portfolio orders up 27% with strong equipment and services orders instant and power conversion Backlog tilted 85 billion flat sequentially and down 1% versus prior year backlog was 71 billion of that sequentially Revenue was down 12% organically largely driven by services In gas power revenue was down 12% Gas power equipment revenue was up 4% organically on higher hitch turbine mix We shipped nine gas turbines versus Oh sorry we shipped seven gas turbines versus nine gas turbines in the first quarter of 19 We helped our customers it's a promotional brazen over 32 units translating to almost 4.7 gigawatts of new power added to the grid Gas power services revenue was down 19% strategy Outages this and transactional sales pushed out of the quarter due to COVID-19 And we had no revenue on higher margin upgrades Despite this services would still have been down in quarter This was driven by supply based constraints on hot gas path parts and outage costs overall pressuring our suicide margin rate Power portfolio revenue was down 12% This was driven by lower volumes across the sub-segments and still we had lower services back low convertibility In nuclear the decline was driven by outage timing and in power conversion we find our sales permitted focused on higher margin market segments Operating profit was down 239 million and segment margin contracted 570 basis points organically The gas power fixed costs were down 9% sequentially and versus prior year This was more than offset by lower service volume and additional costs from COVID-19 disruption Next are renewables continued revenue growth was more than offset by fulfillment and execution issues impacting profitability Orders were down 11% organically equipment was down 11 as we cycle a stronger and services were down 23% A positive spot in the quarter was international orders which were up 11% Backlog of 26.5 billion were down 4% sequentially but up 5% versus prior year Revenue was up 28% organically This was mainly driven by onshore wind up 60% Onshore equipment revenue was up 81% with the new unit turbine deliveries of 731 more than double prior year and repower kit deliveries of 219 up 40% On shore services revenue excluding the power kits was up 15% On short order pricing index continues to stabilize at 1% in line with recent trump grid revenue was down 8% mostly due to site closures and delayed milestones driven by COVID-19 Operating losses was down 115 million This was driven by the supply chain disruptions due to COVID-19 for delays and the non-recurrence of the non-gain non-cash gain from an offshore wind contract termination in the prior year This was partially offset by higher onshore wind volume Segment margin contracted 210 basis points mainly driven by the same items mentioned above and during range of execution issues with fixing at grid and hydro Moving to slide eight Starting with the capita In the quarter adjusted continue operations generated a net loss of 118 million This excludes the impact of the capital loss tax benefit utilized against Biopharma gain resulting in 88 million of earnings Compared to prior year which excludes excludes the tax reform benefit Continuing net earnings was unfavorable by 154 million This was due to negative mark and impairment at and insurance Lower gain and lower earnings from a smaller asset base This was partially offset by lower excess interest costs and as We ended the quarter with 101 billion of assets excluding liquidity This was down 1 billion sequentially primarily driven by due to asset sales depreciation and collection partially offset by new volume Insurance assets were flat sequentially uh as the decrease in unrealized gains driven primarily by higher market rates with effect uh the annual issuance and the capital contribution Supply chain finance assets were down as our suppliers continue to migrate to MUFG As noted earlier capital ended the quarter with 13.5 billion of liquidity Capital also ended with 54.5 billion of debt which was down 4.5 billion sequentially driven by death majority Discontinued operations generated a net loss of 164 million which was unfavorable versus prior year by 200 million If they plan to provide the required support to GE capital in line with insurance statutory funding Next just like our businesses corporate needs to adjust our new realities And we are continuing to take additional structural action to rationalize costs and reduce the size at corporate Looking at the quarter adjusted corporate costs were 374 million 8% higher but that's primarily due to higher inter-company profit elimination which was partially offset by better digital performance from continuing cost reduction actions Sanctions and operations were 25% lower primarily driven by GE Digital improvement You can see from Digital's performance that the focus cost reduction programs are getting traction They continue to right-size our function costs across GE and push more accountability into the division Larry and I are conducting costs and cash reviews of each of the businesses with fresh eyes in the current environment So you can expect that there will be more to come stay tuned I have spent most of my career in leadership at many decentralized companies Fundamentally I believe companies outperform when they have a structure that empowers businesses to take the right actions quickly This type of structure is critical to respond to situations like we have today with COVID-19 but also to be prepared to be able to grow We're working toward this goal and there will be more to come With that back to you Larry thank you There's no question that COVID-19 is putting real pressure on our businesses Given that so much has changed and this quarter will be our first full quarter with pressure from COVID-19 I'd like to spend some time here discussing second quarter trending based on what we're seeing through the month of April So starting with aviation on slide nine of all of our industrial segments this business is feeling the impact of the pandemic most severely The rapid contraction of air travel has resulted in a significant reduction in demand as commercial airlines suspend routes and ground large percentages of their fleets We'll cover commercial services and engines on the next two slides in detail But on the other end of the spectrum demand for our military business remains strong To that end we've re- rebalanced some of our capacity to meet this increased demand To offset some pressure in the commercial business we're taking several steps that while painful preserve our ability to adapt as the environment continues to evolve We've previously announced 500 to one billion in cost in cash actions and we've now increased this targeting more than one billion in cost actions and more than two billion in cash actions This will be achieved through different initiatives some of which have been completed others in flight as we speak These include a 10% reduction in aviation's total US workforce and furloughs impacting 50% of its US maintenance repair and overhaul facilities and new engine manufa- will continue to monitor and potentially extend as required We're also focused on reducing the discretionary and capEx spend and optimizing working capital I know aviation's detrimental margin through this pandemic is top of mind for investors And Karolina touched on the main dynamics impacting our margins in the quarter While we expect our commercial revenues and profits will continue to be down in the second quarter our expectations are that the cost actions we're undertaking will improve detrimental margins in the back half of the year While there are many uncertainties I expect that we will exit the year with a much lower detrimental margin than what you saw in the first quarter So make no mistake driving improvement here is our number one focus As we think about the full year we're tracking travel restrictions carrier and passenger behavior disease countermeasures and freight demand all of which will impact aircraft departures and revenue passenger kilometers While we're seeing an unprecedented decline in 2020 we're taking action and David and the team are working proactively with our customers to navigate through this crisis So spending a little more time on commercial services which represented $3.3 billion of revenue in the first quarter let's go to slide 10 As you can see on the left side departures across the full industry were strong in the first quarter before rapidly declining in mid-March As we look at it this week focused on the GE and CFM fleet global departures are down approximately 75% roughly 60% of the CFM fleet is parked today In line with this we're also seeing significant headwinds in global shop visits which were down low double digits in the first quarter as airlines to first short-term maintenance and we expect this trend gets worse before it gets better with some potential to moderate in the latter half of the year depending on the variables just outlined Based on what we're seeing through the month of April in the second quarter we're seeing shop visits down roughly 60% and CSA billings down roughly 50% Additionally we expect this significant reduction in utilization is likely to continue to pressure our CSA margins That said when the aviation industry recovers and it will recover over time GE is well positioned with the largest and youngest installed base of all engine manufacturers Additionally roughly 62% of our GE CFM fleet has she- has seen one shop visit or less and this will generate demand upon recovery We have more narrow bodies that are 10 years or younger than than the narrow-body installed base of the rest of the industry And when we see a pickup in air travel demand we expect narrow bodies will recover most quickly Overall it was a challenging quarter and we're expecting additional pressure here in the second but our cost actions will alleviate some of the pressure in the second half of 2020 Moving to commercial engines which represented $1.5 billion of revenue in the first quarter in light of COVID-19 Airframers are producing at a lower rate Based on what we're seeing through the month of April in the second quarter we see installed engines down roughly 45% and spare engines down roughly 60% year-on-year attributable to the delivery deferrals in addition to the already planned lower production rate on the 737 MAX In the near-term we're right-sizing production capacity and actively managing the supply base We have very strong relationships with the Airframers and an attractive value proposition is evidenced by a multi-year backlog As you'll see on the right we have strong positions sole source on two of the biggest new engine entrance and a 65% win rate on the other While we acknowledge that there's pressure on near-term demand for new aircraft these stats demonstrate the customers see the value of GE technology We're taking the right actions to be well positioned for the post-pandemic world Moving to healthcare which consists of healthcare systems and PDX In the second quarter to date we're seeing increased demand for vital medical equipment and the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 within healthcare systems Now these product orders including ventilators have increased one and a half to two times versus pre-pandemic levels But at the same time we're seeing reduced demand for other diagnostic products As certain procedures are deferred or canceled around the world To be clear these other diagnostics are still essential and often associated with saving lives in areas including oncology and cardiology but are currently deprioritized PDX is a similar story This is a high margin business made up of contrast agents and nuclear tracers associated with procedures that are being deferred or canceled right now Several HCS product lines and most of PDX is down as much as 50% versus pre-pandemic levels While these dynamics vary by country there appears to be a pattern emerging as geographies experience different stages of the virus Taking China for example as hospitals come back online we're seeing a ramp in previously deferred procedures and increased demand for our

action to rationalize cost and reduce the size of corporate looking at the quarter adjusted corporate costs three hundred and seventy four million at the time higher but that's primarily due to higher into company profit elimination which would partially affect better digital performance from country cost reduction action functions and operations were twenty five percent lower from that of driven by the digital improvement because soon from digital performance that the focus cost reduction programs are getting traction we continue to rightsize our functional cost across to and push more accountability into the division larry and i are conducting cost and cash reviews of each of the businesses with special in the current environment so you can expect that there would be more to come they tuned i have spent most of my career in leadership at least centralized companies fundamentally i believe companies outperform when they have a structure that empowers businesses to take the right actions quickly this type of structure is critical to respond to situations like we have today with covid nineteen but also to be prepared to pivot to grow working toward this goal and there will be more to come that's actually carolina thank you there's no question that coba nineteen is putting real pressure on our businesses given that so much has changed in this quarter will be our first full quarter with pressure from coban nineteen like to spend some time here discussing second quarter trending based on what we're seeing through the month of april so starting with aviation on slide nine of all of our industrial segments this business is feeling the impact of the pandemic most severely the rapid contraction of air travel has resulted in a significant reduction in demand as commercial airlines suspend routes and ground large percentages of their fleets will cover commercial services and engines on the next two slides in detail but on the other end of the spectrum demand for our military business remains strong to that end we rebalanced some of our capacity to meet this increased demand to offset some pressure in the commercial business we are taking several steps that while painful preserve our ability to adapt as the environment continues to evolve we've previously announced five hundred to one billion in cost and cash actions and we've now increased this targeting more than one billion in cost actions and more than two billion in cash action this will be achieved through different initiatives some of which have been completed others in flight as we speak these include a ten percent reduction in aviation's total u s workforce and furloughs impacting fifty percent of its u s maintenance repair and overhaul facilities and new engine manufacture will continue to monitor and potentially extend as required we're also focus on reducing discretionary and cap expend and optimizing working capital i know aviation's detrimental margin through this pandemic is top of mind for investors and carolina touched on the main dynamics impacting our margins in the quarter while we expect our commercial revenues and profits will continue to be down in the second quarter our expectations are that the cost actions we're undertaking will improve decimental margins in the back after the year while there are many uncertainties i expect that we will exit the year with a much lower detrimental margin than what you saw in the first quarter so make no mistake driving improvement here is our number one focus as we think about the full year we're tracking travel restrictions carrier and passenger behavior disease countermeasures and freight demand all of which will impact aircraft departures and revenue passenger kilometers while we're seeing an unprecedented decline in two thousand and twenty we're taking action and david and the team are working proactively with our customers to navigate through this crisis so spending a little more time on commercial services which represented three point three billion dollars of revenue in the first quarter let's go to slide ten as you can see on the left side departures across the full industry were strong in the first quarter before rapidly declining in mid march as we look at it this week focused on the ge and c f m fleet global departures are down approximately seventy five percent roughly sixty percent of the cfm fleet is park today in line with this we're also seeing significant headwinds in global shop visits which were download double digits in the first quarter as airlines defer short term maintenance and we expect this trend gets worse before it gets better with some potential to moderate in the latter half of the year depending on the variables just outlined based on what we're seeing through the month of april in the second quarter we're seeing shop visits down roughly sixty percent and csa billings down roughly fifty percent additionally we expect the significant reduction in utilization is likely to continue to pressure r c s a margins that said when the aviation industry recovers and it will recover over time she is well positioned with the largest and youngest install base of all engine manufacturers additionally roughly sixty two percent of our g e c f m fleet as she has seen one shot visit last and this will generate demand upon recovery we have more narrow bodies that are ten years or younger than the narrow body installed base of the rest of the industry and when we see a pick up in air travel demand we expect narrow bodies will recover most quickly overall it was a challenging quarter and we're expecting additional pressure here in the second but our cost actions will alleviate some of the pressure in the second half of two thousand and twenty building to commercial engines which represented one five billion dollars in revenue in the first quarter in light of coban nineteen airframers are producing at a lower rate based on what we're seeing through the month of april in the second quarter we see installed engines down roughly forty five percent and spare engines down roughly sixty percent year on year attributable to the delivery deferrals in addition to the already planned lower production rate on the seven hundred and thirty seven maps in the near term are right sizing production capacity and actively managing the supply base we have very strong relationships with the airframers and an attractive value proposition is evidenced by a multi year backlog as you'll see on the right we have strong positions sole source on two of the biggest new engine entrance and a sixty five percent win rate on the other while we acknowledge there is pressure on near term demand for new aircraft these staffs demonstrate the customer see the value of g e technology we're taking the right actions to be well positioned for the post pandemic world moving to health care which consists of health care systems and p d x in the second quarter to date we're seeing increased demand for vital medical equipment in the diagnosis and treatment of code in nineteen within health care systems now these product orders including ventilators have increased one and a half to two times versus pre pandemic levels but at the same time we're seeing reduced demand for other diagnostic products as certain procedures are deferred or cancelled around the world to be clear these other diagnostics are still essential and often associated with saving lives in areas including oncology and cardiology that are currently deprioritized pediac to a similar story this is a high margin this is made of a contrast agents and nuclear tracers associated with procedures that are being deferred or cancelled right now several hcs product lines and most of p d x is down as much as fifty percent versus prepandemic levels while these dynamics vary by country there appears to be a pattern emerging as geographies experience different

Looking forward we're most focused on the following indicators for healthcare hospital admission and and occupancy rates and increase in non COVID-19 procedures changes in hospital CapEx budgets government spending on healthcare broadly and development of COVID 19 tests treatments and vaccines Based on our experience in China and the market in April we expect to be down in the second quarter with potential recovery afterwards COVID-19 has highlighted the need to build and truly invest and and scale a new digitized infrastructure and quickly We're committed to our investments in our digital Edison platform and solutions like Mural Virtual Care Solution which allows one clinician to remotely view numerous ventilated patients simultaneously helping to expand their capacity while reducing their risk of exposure As our digital healthcare journey continues we're at the center of an ecosystem striving for precision health I'm very proud of the work our team is doing to combat COVID-19 Moving to power on slide nine On slide 13 we'll talk to the current trending in the second quarter to date and dynamics at gas power and power portfolio Starting with gas power equipment while we're monitoring and managing supply chain disruptions as of today we still see a path to 45 to 50 gas turbine deliveries this year But our orders profile and therefore cash down payments were several hundred million dollars or likely weaker due to IPP pressures in the US and Mexico as we expect that deal financing will become harder through the year Additionally with oil price pressure impacting middle East and SSA investment including demand for new LNG we are expecting a longer road to normalization Ultimately we're sticking to our strategy of securing a lower risk margin of creative backlog with disciplined execution In services approximately 20% of planned averages are shifting from the first half of this year due to COVID-19 field labor constraints We're also seeing pressure on upgrades primarily in the middle East where low oil prices are impacting customer budgets We are seeing GE gas turbine utilization in the US up mid-single digits due to low gas prices and the shift from coal but utilization globally is down low-double digits due to lower electricity demand Within power portfolio our steam business is most impacted Factory closures pressured our steam operations including one facility in move-on which was closed for approximately eight weeks in the first quarter Today we're back up to more than 70% of capacity The global supply chain has also been disrupted by the shutdown in India driven by government restrictions Overall we're seeing about 30% of outages shift from the first half of this year to the second half with another 10-15 % pushing into next year Our power businesses are taking several measures to offset these pressures In the first quarter where we reduced head count by 700 notified approximately 1300 contractors implemented a hiring freeze and in line with the demand profile we are taking even further actions This was serve to reduce six costs in 2020 and drive benefits in 2021 Looking forward we're tracking a number of items including timing of our gas turbine new order closure service outages and volume leak utilization in the energy mix and fuel prices are impacting each region differently supplier impacts and project execution billing milestones and customer collections We're targeting to have our accelerated cost out measures drive organic margin expansion despite these demand changes Moving to slide 14 on renewables there was a limited impact of COVID-19 in the first quarter and our disappointing results continue to be largely about improving execution As we've said we think about renewables in three distinct operating pools Starting with onshore wind while we continue to deliver at record levels in the Americas we are seeing supply chain disruption at our LM Wind facilities and we're monitoring key commercial milestones such as permitting and financing which could potentially cause timing delays In offshore wind certification for our industry leading turbine the Haliade-X remains on track We're also on plan to start delivering on our 80-unit six megawatt commitments to EDF After completion of this project in 2021 we expect to start shifting production to the Haliade-X We're also monitoring financial closure of 2020 deals Grid and hydro are two turnarounds are impacted by supply chain disruptions with over half of our grid facilities now operating below full capacity And a grid automation were also impacted by lower book-to-bill order conversion Across all three of these pools we're increasing cost down in restructuring and we've identified several hundred million dollars of additional actions Longer-term a lower cost structure will benefit renewables Relating to the global supply chain we're focused on the safe reopening of our plants globally and then optimizing the workforce and plant load levels Looking forward we're expecting a larger impact of COVID-19 in the second quarter and by business we're tracking 20 and 21 demand impact on progress collections and potential site delays in onshore wind The risk of financing delays associated with deals at offshore project site delays at grid and hydro and the backlog at grid On slide 15 within GE capital our and insurance businesses are where we were feeling the largest impacts so I'll keep my comments focused there First G- CAS is better positioned today than in previous downturns with better asset quality less customer concentration and more geographic diversity That said we're preparing for elevated repossessions and redeployments as well as lease restructurings and we've had approximately 80% of our customers seek short-term deferrals As you may have seen we agreed with going on a rebalancing of our 737 MAX order book Second at insurance market and rate volatility is impacting the current value of our investment portfolio and reinvestment yields Therefore we're deploying capital to capture market dislocation investment opportunities We're closely monitoring how this volatility will impact insurance this year And similar to the industrial segments we're implementing incremental cost and cash actions Looking forward we continue to expect higher impairments and lower asset sales at G- CAS and insurance Our seasoned teams are working closely with our customers to navigate through this period So to close our priorities are clear We rapidly mobilized our team in the face of COVID-19 with our top priority being the health and safety of our employees And overall the priorities we reviewed with you at the outlook call remain intact We're into our near term realities while continuing to manage GE for the long-term When the world is facing the worst pandemic in a century our team is rising to the challenge with humility transparency and focus We continue to deliver value for our customers enabling air carriers to transport essential goods supplying vital healthcare equipment and keeping the lights on And while there are many unknowns there will be another side Planes will fly again Healthcare will normalize and modernize And the world still needs more efficient resilient energy At the same time we're embracing this new reality We're redefining winning and we're executing our plan The cost and cash we've taken you through this morning are a major result These moves will ultimately allow us to accelerate our multi-year transformation to make GE a stronger nimbler and more valuable company And I am confident that GE will emerge stronger With that Steve let's go to questions Great Uh before we open the line I'd ask everyone in the queue to consider your fellow analysts again and ask one question and a follow-up so we can get to as many people as possible Brandon can you please open the line Yes Thank you sir We'll now begin the question-and-answer session If you have a question please press * 1 on your telephone keypad If you'd like to be removed from the queue please press the pound sign or the hash key If you're on a speakerphone please pick up your handset first before dialing Once again if you have a question please press * 1 on your telephone keypad And from Vertical Research we have Jeff Sprague Please go ahead Thank you Good morning everyone Hope everyone is well Um thanks for all the uh the great details Good morning Jeff Good morning Um I was hoping you could uh provide a little bit of color on how you uh you know kind of view the kind of the asset quality of the you know the contractual service agreements and the like Right There's a lot of assets there Obviously there's at least uh a temporary impairment of cash flows Um how does that test work Have you done it yet And are are you close to any particular thresholds there that we should be thinking about Jeff I I think if if we look at the uh th- the service backlog right broadly just under $325 billion for the company uh the vast majority of that $234 billion is in Aviation I suspect that's that's where you're most focused We we go through those uh those backlog reviews and the CSA uh reviews on a regular basis Uh what we've done here over the last uh call it the last seven eight weeks is really tighten and quicken the review process that we do with the uh the businesses both uh at Aviation and at GECAS What we're trying to do is make sure we've got the latest and um if you will most uh most accurate information possible with respect to customer risk given uh given everything that's that's going on So we we we do that on a regular basis We did that at the f- at the end of the first quarter in uh in in closing much as we do every quarter Clearly we've got a uh we we've got a fluid uh situation And I think the uh the modest charges that we took uh the modest changes in the first quarter clearly are gonna play out as we go through the course of the year We can't really scope that uh for you today If you look at the CSA book and Aviation for example uh as we went through the uh the mechanics of the future billings the future costs related to those billings uh based on the information at the time it was really just 100-billion d- $100 -million uh adjustment non-cash of course which is why you see a little bit of the earnings cash uh dynamic Uh certainly as we go forward we're gonna be updating uh those uh those adjustments And again w- we would expect that we would see uh more of that uh given what the airlines are doing with uh with their planes But I think it's important to keep in mind again you know these these are 10 to 15-year agreements as you know and uh those adjustments are take- taken in the context of that uh uh particularly extended time period Great Thanks for that And just as a followup if I could um I know you don't want to get real precise on guidance but uh you know you you are uh pointing us to uh a further decline in cashflow in Q2 which isn't surprising quite quite frankly But uh could you bracket that at all for us what we should expect for for Q2 And uh you know any high level thoughts on how the year plays out from the cash standpoint Yeah Jeff I I think that we uh we took guidance off the table a few weeks back and um didn't want to take a uh an attempt at at at framing formal guidance here today in light of all that is fluid and all that is is still evolving here And I think that the tack we took was really to try to to to share as much with you as as we possibly could in terms of the uh the April detail business by business um and acknowledge that we're gonna see a uh a more challenging uh second quarter here given the full impact of of COVID and the like Uh but beyond that I think that's that's really where we are We we we know we've got to to get to work on the cost and the cash actions That's why you see us doubling that activity in Aviation stepping it up um elsewhere uh around the company So uh the the $2 billion of costs the $3 billion of cash uh will clearly help us later uh on in the year if those uh those actions uh take uh take root But for today I think that's really what we're uh that's what we know and that's what we're comfortable sharing Great Thanks Best of luck Larry Thanks From Morgan Stanley we have Josh Pokrzywinski Thanks Jeff Please go ahead Josh your line's open Josh You might be on mute Josh you might be on mute Josh Josh are you there Why don't we uh w- Brandon let's uh move on and come back to Josh Okay Sure Next question we have from Bank of America we have Andrew Obin Please go ahead Uh yes good morning Can you hear me Good morning Andrew Yep Yeah I can I can hear you Um yeah just a question on Thank you so much And um uh good luck to everybody Um so run rate minus 60% in terms of shop visits uh 50% in CSA Do you think you'll continue to trend at this level in the second quarter or is there a more downside Andrew the uh I think you're referring to to page nine in the slide deck Yeah There it is Yeah I think this is what uh you know what we're seeing here Yeah I I think this is what we're uh what we're seeing right now Right And given uh given what the carriers have uh have said publicly what they're doing and we think these are uh these are good likely uh year-end run rates to share with you We're again we're not um trying to offer up a definitive view as to the next several quarters Uh but this is you know this is what we're seeing right now in the second quarter for sure And uh my my follow-up question on uh engine sales I think uh minus 60% uh have we lost these or will these come back uh when the situation normalizes Maybe you can give us some sort of framework how to think about spare engine demand over the next couple of years Thank you so much Andrew we were uh we were ramping uh spares with with both the uh the LEAP-1A a and the LEAP-1B as uh the narrow-body market was taking off uh typical early in the life of an engine activity Uh w- we are clearly seeing that uh soften uh not necessarily going to zero uh as preparations are being made for the return to service of the Max Right Uh I don't think that that that opportunity is lost but I think like much of what we're seeing in aviation broadly it will be uh it will be pushed out for a few years And again I don't think we're taking a definitive view as to what year what quarter things uh get back to if you will a normalized 2019 level Uh but we recognize uh the uh the discussions out there about this being a multi-year uh recovery gradual slow like we're embracing that reality and that applies uh really across the portfolio both on the OE side as well as the aftermarket spares included Thank you very much for all the detail and stay safe Thank you Likewise Andrew Thank you From Melius Research we have From Melius Research we have Scott Davis Please go ahead Hey good morning guys And welcome Carolina Thank you Larry Any Uh good morning Larry Any any way to think about the cost actions as it relates to kind of structural versus more kind of pandemic short-term related Sure Well I I would I would say Scott as you well know that when we're in a we're in a mode like this you're uh you're you're moving as quickly as you possibly can um almost anywhere that you can So if you look at what we've announced at Aviation the doubling of those activities today the the the broadening across the company Uh if you look at the the tally today there is a decidedly short-term bias there that Carolina and I are going to be working with the CEOs over the coming weeks to uh transition to a more permanent uh action Right If you look at what we did in Aviation for example example in terms of the temporary lack of works uh that was a way to quickly adjust our cost structure in that business on a variable basis to these uh shockingly fast changes uh in demand You might categorize that as as temporary we need to work through uh the changes on a more permanent basis that are required in in light of the uh the length of the recovery that we're looking at So we have confidence in these in these numbers that we're sharing today the $2 billion of costs the $3 billion of cash Uh there's a bit of uh tactical bias today just given how fresh this is but we will be leaning in toward making more of them permanent Recognizing that at the end of the day there will be a uh a bit of a mix uh be it be it headcount related discretionary spend on the cost side in addition to some of the working capital and certainly the the the capex reduction that Carolina referenced the 25% reduction uh year on year So a lot going on and uh by no means is this uh uh these headlines today the uh the end", "pred_text": "r and d deferring cap x and optimizing working capital looking forward we're most focused on the following indicators for health care hospital admission and occupancy rates an

freeze and in line with the demand profile we are taking even further actions this will serve to reduce fixed costs in two thousand and twenty and drive benefits in two thousand and twenty one looking forward we are tracking a number of items including timing of our gas turbine new order closure service outages in volume utilization is the energy mix and fuel prices are impacting each region differently supplier impacts and project execution billing milestones and customer collections we're targeting to have our accelerated cost out measures drive organic margin expansion despite these demand changes moving to slide fourteen on renewables there was a limited impact of code nineteen in the first quarter and our disappointing results continue to be largely about improving execution as we have said we think about renewables and three distinct operating pools starting with onshore wind while we continue to deliver at record levels in the americas we are seeing supply chain disruption at our l m wind facilities and we're monitoring key commercial milestones such as permitting and financing which could potentially cause timing delays in offshore wind certification for our industry leading turbine the hollywood x remains on track we're also on plan to start delivering on our eighty unit six megawatt commitments to ed after completion of this project in two thousand and twenty one we expect to start shipping production to the holly audience we're also monitoring financial closure of two thousand and twenty deals grid and hydro are two turnarounds are impacted by supply chain disruptions with over half of our great facilities now operating below capacity and a grid automation were also impacted by lower book to bill order conversion across all three of these pools we're increasing cost out in restructuring and we have identified several hundred dollars million of additional actions longer term a lower cost structure will benefit renewables relating to the global supply chain we are focused on the safe reopening of our plants globally and then optimizing the workforce and plant load levels looking forward we were expecting a larger impact from covid nineteen in the second quarter and by business we're tracking twenty and twenty one demand impact progress collections and potential site delays in onshore wind the risk of financing delays associated with deals that offshore project site delays a grid and hydro and the backlog at grid on slide fifteen with ng capital rg caps insurance businesses are where we are feeling the largest impacts so i'll keep my comments focused there first she cast is better positioned today than in previous downturns with better asset quality less customer concentration and more geographic diversity that said we're preparing for elevated repossessions and redeployments as well as lease restructuring and we've had approximately eighty percent of our customers seek short term referrals as you may have seen we've agreed with going on a rebalancing of our seventy seven match order book second at insurance marketing rate volatility is impacting the current value of our investment portfolio and reinvestment yields therefore capital to capture market dislocation investment opportunities we're closely monitoring how this volatility will impact insurance this year and similar to the industrial segments we're implementing a criminal cost and cash actions looking forward we continue to expect higher impairments and lower asset sales of gas and insurance our season teams are working closely with our customers to navigate through this period so to close our priorities are clear we rapidly mobilized our team in the face of kobe nineteen with our top priority being the health and safety of our employees and overall the priorities we viewed with you at the outlook call remain intact we're facing into our near term realities while continuing to manage g e for the long term when the world is facing the worst pandemic in a century our team is rising to the challenge with humility transparency and focus we continue to deliver value for our customers enabling air carriers to transport essential goods supplying vital health care equipment and keeping the lights on and while there are many unknowns there will be another side planes will fly again health care will normalize and modernize and the world still needs more efficient resilient energy at the same time we are embracing this new reality we are redefining winning and we're executing our plan the cost and cash ashes we've taken you through this morning are a major result these moves will ultimately allow us to accelerate our multi year transformation to make g e a stronger number and more valuable company and i'm confident that g e will emerge stronger with that steve let's go to questions great before we open the line i'd ask everyone in the queue to consider your fellow analysts again and ask one question in a follow up so we can get to as many people as possible brandon can you please open the line thank you sir will now begin the question and answer session if you have a question please press star one and your telephone keep it if you'd like to be removed from the queue please press the pound side or the hatch if you're on a speakerphone please pick up your headset first before dialing once again if you have a question please press star one hundred telephone keypad and from vertical research we have jeff spray please go ahead thank you good morning everyone everyone as well thanks for all the great morning jeff good morning i was hoping you could provide a little bit of color on how you you know kind of view the kind of the asset quality of you know the contractual service agreements and the like there's a lot of assets there obviously there's at least a temporary impairment of cash flows how does that test work have you done it yet and are you close to any particular threshold there that we should be thinking about yes i think if if we look at the service backlog right broadly just under three hundred and twenty five billion for the company the vast majority of that two hundred and thirty four billion is in aviation i suspect that that's where you're most focused we we go through those those backlog reviews in the c s a reviews on a regular basis what we've done here over the last call the last seven eight weeks is really tighten and quicken the review process that we do with the businesses both at aviation and we're trying to do is make sure we've got the latest and if you will most accurate information possible with respect to customer risk given given everything that's that's going on so we do that on a regular basis we did that at the at the end of the first quarter in closing much as we do every quarter clearly we've got a we've got a fluid situation and i think the modest charges that we took the modest changes in the first quarter clearly are going to play out as we go through the course of the year we can't really scope that for you today if you look at the c s a book in aviation for example as we went through the mechanics of the future billings the future costs related to those billings based on the information the time it was really just one hundred billion one hundred million dollars adjustment non cash of course which is why you see a little bit of the earnings cash dynamic certainly as we go forward we're going to be updating those those adjustments and again i think we would expect that we would see more of that given what the airlines are doing with their planes but i think it's important to keep in mind again you know these these are ten to fifteen year agreements as you know and those adjustments are take taken in the context of that particularly extended time period great thanks for that and just as a follow up if i could i know you don't want to get real precise on guidance but you know you you are pointing us to a further decline in cash flow in q two which isn't surprising quite quite frankly but could you bracket that at all for us what we should expect for you too you know any high level thoughts on how the year plays out from the cash standpoint jeff i think that we we took guidance off the table a few weeks back and didn't want to take an attempt at framing formal guidance here today in light of all that this flu and all that it's still a ball here and i think that the tack we took was really to try to share as much with you we possibly could in terms of the the april detail business by business and acknowledge that we're going to see a more challenging second quarter here given the full impact of coburn and the like but beyond that i think that's that's really where we are we know we've got to get to work on the cost in the cash actions that's why you see it's doubling that activity navy ation stepping it up elsewhere around the company so the two billion of cost the three billion of cash will clearly help us later on in the year as those those actions take take root but for today i think that's really what we're that's what we know and that's what we're comfortable sharing thanks best a lot larry thanks from morgan stanley we have pokers whiskey please go ahead josh your line is open josh you might be actually there why don't we brandon must let's move on to come back to josh church question we have from bank of america we have inter open please go ahead yes good morning commander yeah i didn't quite go here you want thank you so much and good luck to everybody so run rate minus sixty percent in terms of shop visits fifty percent of c s a do you think you continue to trend of the flow in the second quarter or is there more downside and through the i think you're referring to page nine of the slide deck yeah i think what we're seeing here yeah i think this is what we're what we're seeing right now right and given given what the carriers have said publicly what they're doing and we think these are these are good likely near end run rates to share with you we're get we're not trying to offer up a definitive view as to the next several quarters but this is you know this is what we're seeing right now in the second quarter for sure and my follow up question on engine sales i think minus sixty percent have we lost these all will these come back when the situation normalizes maybe you can give us some sort of framework how to think about engine demand over the next couple of years thank you so much and or we were we were ramping spares with with both the leap want to and the leap one b as the narrow body market was taking off typical early in the life of an engine activity we are clearly seeing that soften not necessarily going to zero as preparations are being made for the return to service of the max right i don't think that that opportunity is lost but i think much of what we're seeing in aviation broadly it will be it will be pushed out few years and again i don't think we're taking a definitive view as to what year what quarter things get back to if you will a normalized twenty one thousand level but we recognize the discussion out there about this being a multi year recovery gradual slow embracing that reality and that applies really across the portfolio both on the o e side as well as the aftermarket spares included thank you very much for all the detail and stay safe thank you for ideas research for billious research we have scott davis please go ahead good morning guys and welcome carolina thank you larry any good morning larry any any way to think about the cost actions relates to kind of structural versus more kind of pandemic short term related sure well i would i would say scott as you well know that when we're in a when we're in a mode like this you're moving as quickly as you possibly can almost anywhere that you can so if you look at what we've been out that aviation the doubling of those activities today the broadening across the company if you look at the tally today there is a decidedly short term bias there that carolina and i are going to be working with the c e o s over the coming weeks to transition to a more permanent action right if you look at what we did in aviation for example example in terms of the temporary lack of works that was a way to quickly adjust our cost structure in that business on a variable basis to these shockingly fast changes in demand you might categorize that as temporary we need to work through the changes on a more permanent basis that are required and light of the the length of the recovery that we're looking at so we have confidence in these in these numbers that we're sharing today the two billion of costs the three billion of cash there's a bit of a tactical bias today just given how fresh this is but we will be leaning in toward making more of them permanent recognizing that the end of the day there will be a bit of a mix be it be it headcount related discretionary spend on the cost side in addition to some of the working capital certainly the cap x reduction the carolina reference the twenty five percent reduction year on year so a lot going on and by no means is this these headlines today the the end it's very much", "wer": 0.2685430463576159, "tokens": 3020, "ins_rate":

you know that the $20 billion kind of came to you pretty much about perfect timing but you know does that money just sit on the balance Does that have to sit on the balance sheet pretty much as is for the for the year Can you Or is it just such a big number you can start to parse some of it out to think of in terms of whittling down some of the you know debt that you can you can manage Well we uh It it it it did come at a uh at a at a good time Uh there's there's no question That's why we put the emphasis in in the biopharma set up uh on on on certainty right We want to take the market risk off the table relative to thinking through the uh the healthcare options Carolina anything uh you want to add relative to kind of managing liquidity versus leverage right here I think that's Yeah I I think it's it's important to acknowledge that the world is different now compared to like before COVID And it's very important for us of course leverage is important but liquidity is very important Uh and we end the quarter with $47 billion cash right And that's really to cover $13 billion of GE and GE Capital long-term debt maturities now through ' 21 And actually after the April actions we are down to $13 billion of maturities for ' 20 and ' 21 almost all of that in in capital Um and I would also say that we expect to have around $20 billion in total credit lines going forward And that's really in line with our risk appetite We have the new $15 billion three-year RCF that I mentioned and $5 billion either will be on 20 billion credit lines I think we're just so that you know we we really intend to maintain a high level of cash I would say to maximize flexibility And that's why we're taking these actions also to de-risk our balance sheet and basically prudently manage our liquidity in these very challenging external environment and time That that makes sense And thank you and good luck to you guys Thank you Thanks Scott Be well Yeah let's try Josh Pokrzywinski again from Morgan Stanley Please go ahead sir Hi there Can you hear me this time Yes Yes Clearly Josh good morning Awesome Um and and hope everyone is is well to echo earlier comments W- Larry can you just give us a sense and I I know you guys have data going back eons in in Aviation How the impact of of retirements and cannibalizations you know kind of make more of a uh a U shape versus you know what you know the the air traffic may look like Is is there a natural lag between when folks start flying again and when when shop visits can happen just as a function of kind of using up some of the runtime on on otherwise idled assets Well Josh uh you know certainly we have uh we have revisited the history The team is uh is well-versed in in what we have seen in years past I'm not sure we've we've seen anything uh kind of on par with uh with this Um but there's there's no question that there's there's going to be a bias on the part of some as some of these fleet uh reductions play out to retire some of the older aircraft Um and that will factor into the uh to the aftermarket much like some of the dynamics around green time and how you're in the short-term uh folks try to preserve cash carriers try to preserve cash in uh in in their business So I'm not sure that there is necessarily uh an exact model that captures what all the carriers in aggregate are going to do here uh a model that offers great precision I think we do know that this that the combination of these factors is gonna create pressure for us um a force here in the short term Uh I think what's most important for our business really is is cycles much more so than rev- uh revenue passenger miles Uh and as we see schedules come back as we work our way through the pandemic that will uh that'll put us back on I think better footing but here in the short term I think we're acknowledging that we're gonna see shop visits and CSA billings uh take on some real pressure due to the downturn Understood Thanks I'll leave it there From JP Morgan we have Steve Tusa Please go ahead Thanks Josh Uh hey guys Good morning Hey Steve Good morning Good morning Um in in uh in early March you guys had that slide that showed um you know $2 to $4 billion in you know free cash flow guidance which is obviously off the table But you also talked about things growing in you know ' 21 and ' 22 and you know off that kind of $3 billion base I think you know most uh research and um numbers I saw were kind of in that you know um $6 billion range of of free cash flows to kind of growth off of that level Are are we still um Like is is are the IATA numbers um still at all legit or is that you know are are you kind of withdrawing that long-term outlook as well Steve I think we have admittedly been on taking the right actions both the costs the cash the uh the balance sheet actions here in the short term in the face of this uh this unprecedented dyna- pandemic Um we've taken guidance off for the year We're not putting it back on today just given the uh given the undue un- uncertainty of it all Right So I I don't uh I don't think we're trying to get out any further than than that Um I appreciate the question but I think for purposes of today we're really just trying to um frame for folks what what we're seeing But that said however long uh it takes us to work through this I think we feel very good about our ability to come out stronger and get back on a uh on a positive uh cashflow growth trajectory Got got it And- Carolina anything you would add to that Uh well no I think it's important to to acknowledge that by taking out cost now and part of it being structural that gives us sort of self-mitigating the decremental that helps improving the incremental The the the outer years I mean that would depend on the recovery on the industries as well So so that's that's I would say almost impossible to to speak to today R- right And and I guess how much on that's structural costs side Yeah Yeah Steve Yeah go ahead Yeah no I'm just just one one other point I think worth mentioning I mean I think what we're acknowledging here is that assistance played out in March and and what we're seeing already in April Right It it really is hitting uh hitting us from a mix a mix perspective hard uh our highest margin businesses are really feeling it here I would think that on the on the recovery we would see um we would see it swing the other way When we get back uh and come off a bottom we should have positive mixed effect uh really across the across the board particularly in Aviation and healthcare Yeah Um y- your your second question Steve is relative to the cost actions and how much permanent how much uh not permanent Yeah I I know I guess how much is that gonna cost you I mean like you know to come up with 2 to $3 billion of of cost and cash you know you've done you you cut your restructuring last year pretty significantly needed a couple hundred million in the first quarter Um I mean uh most companies kind of one for one uh what how much is this stuff gonna cost you this year on a cash basis Yeah I I think what we have said um previously we were gonna be down off of last year from a uh from an expense and from a cash perspective I think we're we're uh probably gonna end up more or less in line Right Keep in mind that some of the cost actions like furloughs don't carry a restructuring charge with that Right Uh because they aren't permanent So part of what we're trying to do is squeeze out some of the temporary costs Um but all the while if we can uh we can make more structural moves we want to make sure we've got room to do that But I'd say right now assume that it uh be relatively flat year on year but as Carolina indicated in her remarks um we wanna try to do more if we can Great All right Thanks all That that's all I have guys Thanks Steve From UBS we have Markus Mittermaier Please go ahead All right Good morning Larry Carolina and Steve Um let me maybe follow up on the uh on the Aviation- Marcus good morning um hey good morning um within the year So in your Q 10-Q you've referenced the IATA numbers of 48% RPK reduction If if and I know obviously fly dollars and RPKs are are two different stories But is that sort of a uh a kind of scenario that you're playing through internally And and I'm just trying to get a sense of what that would mean if we look at our sort of like ' 19 Aviation cash as a baseline sort of like where you know on on that type of scenario we could end up particularly you know looking at sort of what you've mentioned in your prepared re- remarks that you have I think 62% of of engines still ahead of shop visits one which arguably are the engines that are on the narrow bodies coming back first because they're probably the youngest um the youngest in the fleet Right Right And so I'm just trying to get a sense for within the year how you're thinking about that Well I I I think that given what we what we highlighted relative to the the the April experience and the near-term projection of that um there's no question that we're gonna continue to see the pressure on uh on cash at Aviation that we've seen uh here of late Right And that that will be our um undoubtedly our our biggest headwind No Sure sure sure but uh you know the uh the you know sh- shop visits we heard sort of the the numbers that you that you said but did you do sort of internal internal um stress test around um w- where you could end up or is that is that just something that you say it's it's too early to comment No no no There's there's there's plenty there's plenty of of of planning for uh again a uh an extended uh slowdown here We're we're we're embracing this reality to the fullest extent possible We are not expecting uh this to bounce back uh in in the near term So we we we flag in the queue the IATA numbers we also reference others You see it in our own uh departure data here in April right We are we are we are way down that has a direct feed into shop visits CSA billings and the like So we're- we're- we're adapting to this new environment confident that it will recover So we're Marcus we're- we're simply not trying to uh- uh assume that- that the- the pressure abates anytime soon Witness the uh the cost and the cash actions that we're taking Sure Okay No I appreciate that And may- maybe as a followup quickly on- on the capital side do you anticipate um any change in the in the capital support there For- for insurance in particular you- you- you referenced that a little bit in the prepared remarks I think two billion is sort of the current number How are you thinking about that at the moment On the current support uh to capital um- Yeah on the insurance- Yeah let's Yeah Let's take a step back then So uh in ' 19 the capital had an infusion from uh GE of four billion Right And the estimate for- for this year is two billion uh on the insurance funding Um and those two billion um you know they're significantly lower than the year uh before Um we estimated that the will need to support roughly variables are still open and that depends on GE capital itself Right GE capital earnings the- the the capital and the asset liquidity levels But basically it's about two billion as it looks now Um and I would also say going forward followup uh we do continue to- to anticipate further funding Um and that will be again through a combination of GE capital itself through their asset liquidity and their future earnings Um and on top of that possible capital contributions from GE Thank you From Cohen and Company we have Please go ahead Yeah thank you Good morning guys Good morning Two question uh two questions So- Morning at- at Aviation it sounds like you guys acknowledge that on the way up um the spares business the aftermarket the $15 billion commercial aftermarket business will lag ASM growth because of you know a younger fleet emerging you know uh a surge of used serviceable material and the like part outs and obviously lower spares provisioning as the OE rates come down 30% to 50% I guess first question is when do you anticipate Aviation-free cashflow uh getting to break even Is it even possible before calendar ' 22 uh in that in ty- type of environment And then I have a followup I'm not I'm not sure we would buy into the premise per say Right I mean we- we- we are a cycles business much more so um than- than any other indicator And those cycles are gonna have to come back uh before the passengers do Uh a- as you indicated the age of the fleet will- will help us over time There could be some short-term headwinds But we'll uh we'll- we'll see how that plays out Um I think I think what we're acknowledging here is that we've been hit from a free cash perspective uh in our uh kind of our- our- our biggest and best cash generator at- at Aviation Uh but we're really not getting into uh much more much more in terms of the uh the- the pre-cash forecast on- on a multi-year basis It's just too soon There's just too many uh moving pieces for us to uh to be that forward leaning at this point We wish we could be It's just it's just not where we are Okay And just a followup you know obviously 2020's a tough year We're gonna have some cash burn 2021 unclear but certainly doesn't seem like in Aviation we're gonna have a strong recovery Um any So- so as we emerge from this we're gonna have you know more leverage And I- I guess the question is you guys have made some asset sales to de-leverage What else besides cost reduction can you do um to get the balance sheet better uh faster Is there any other things that you guys are exploring or that you might explore that's different than what you've done over the past year Thank you Well I would- I'm not sure I would say that there's a lot that is No please Carolina I- I was I was gonna say that to do things that we haven't done- Well I- I- I would say- in the last couple of years Yeah Well I- I would just I would just say at- at- at a high level we- we are committed to our de-leveraging target of less than two and a half times on the industrial side And I think you've seen us make a lot of progress year to date which I hope underscores uh the seriousness of- of- of that objective both on the GE side right I think it's seven billion of uh of debt reductions in the quarter And uh capital I think it's up to 10 um on- on a year to date business given- given some of the things we did in April Clearly it's gonna take us a- a- a while longer here to hit those targets like I- I suspect most- most companies But in terms of doing anything new or different I think we're gonna continue to try to run these businesses as- as best we can be as disciplined as we can on the capital front uh be- be- be smart and thoughtful relative to some of the other obligations like uh like pension as you've seen us relative to uh the plan design and- and some of the settlement options So I'm not sure they're necessarily new plays per se Uh but we'll continue to- to look at- at every and- and every option available to continue to strengthen the company strengthen the balance sheet bring those leverage levels down in the face of uh of COVID-19 Carolina I'm sorry I jumped in there Anything to add there I would just add that uh to the leverage comment also the liquidity That at times like this you know you do look at the liquidity And uh I think it's important to say that um you really want to maintain a high level of trust to maximize the flexibility Uh and you have the de-risking activities that we have made um to sort of push out the debt and uh for the year So Thank you Yeah And I and I- I But I but I think to that I mean it's just important for us all to remember we- we ended the quarter with 47 billion of liquidity um on the back of the bio pharma action and some of the other things that we have uh done So we'll- we'll continue to be nimble and- and flexible uh mindful of- of- of our obligations and our reality Okay And from Barclays we have Julian Mitchell Please go ahead Hi Good morning Um maybe uh just a question around- Good morning Julian Good morning Uh maybe just a first question around the um the working capital uh dynamics and the free cashflow at Aviation Um I guess yeah there's a lot of industrial businesses where when you get this rapid sales down draft you get a working capital cash offset to an extent And then it reverses", "pred_text": "in broad ground ok that's helpful area and we think you know that the twenty billion dollars kind of came to you pretty much about perfect timing but you know does that money just sit on the ballot does have to sit on the balance sheet pretty much as it is for the for the year can you or is it just such a big number you can start to parse some of it out thinking in terms of going down some of the debt that you can you can manage well we it did come at a at a good time there's no question that's why we put the emphasis in the bio pharma set up on certainty we want to take the market risk off the table relative to thinking through the health care options carolina anything you want to add relative to kind of managing liquidity versus leverage right here i think i think it's important to acknowledge that the world is different now compared to before covid very important for us of course leverage is important but liquidity is very important we end the quarter with forty seven billion cash right and that's really to cover capital long term debt which is now to twenty one and actually after the april action we are down to thirteen billion of maturities for twenty and twenty one of acting in capital i would also say you know we expect to have around twenty billion in total credit lines going forward that's really in line with our risk appetite have been fifteen billion three year r c s that i mentioned five billion twenty credit lines i think we just said that you know we really intend to maintain a high level of cash i would say to maximize flexibility and that's why we're taking this action for to do we still balance it and basically proven to monitor only quit in this very challenging external environment time that makes sense and thank you and good luck to you guys thank you thanks got the well and let's try just brokers when skeegan from morgan stanley please go ahead can you hear me this time yes yes good morning awesome and hope everyone is as well that go earlier comments where you can you just give us a sense and i know you guys have data going back and aviation how the impact of retirements and cannibalizations you know kind of make more of a you shape versus you know what you know the air traffic may look like is is there a natural lag between when folks start flying again and when when shop visits can happen just as a function of kind of using up some of the run time on otherwise idled assets well josh you know certainly we have we have revisited the history of the team is well versed and what we have seen in years past not sure we've seen anything kind of on par with with this but there's no question that there's going to be a bias on the part of some of these fleet reductions play out to retire some of the older aircraft and that will factor into the to the aftermarket much like some of the dynamics around green time and how you're in the short term folks try to preserve cash carriers try to preserve cash in their business so i'm not sure that there is necessarily an exact model that captures what all the carriers and aggregate are going to do here a model that offers great precision i think we do know that this that the combination of these factors is going to create pressure for us force here in the short term i think what's most important for our business really is cycles much more so than red revenue passenger miles and as we see schedules come back as we work our way through the pandemic that will that will put us back on i think better footing but here in the short term i think we're knowledge ing that we're going to see shop visits and see if they billings take on some real pressure due to the downturn understood thanks i'll leave it there from j p morgan we have steve good morning a steve good morning in in early march you guys had that slide that showed you know two dollars billion in you know free cash flow guidance which is obviously off the table but you also talked about things growing and you know twenty one and twenty two and you know off that kind of three billion dollars base i think you know most research and numbers i saw were kind of in that you know six billion dollars range of free cash flows a kind of growth off of that level are we still are the out your numbers still at all legit or is that you know are you kind of withdrawing that long term outlook as well steve i think we have made leave been focused on taking the right actions both the cost the cash the balance sheet actions here in the short term in the face of this unprecedented died pandemic we've taken guidance off for the year we're not putting it back on today just given the given the undue uncertainty of it all right so i don't i don't think we're trying to get out any further than the mat appreciate the question but i think for purposes of today really just trying to frame for folks what we're saying but that said however long it takes us to work through this i think we feel very good about our ability to come out stronger and get back on a on a positive cash flow growth trajectory got it early and you would add to that well no i think it's important to to acknowledge that by taking out costs now and part of it being structural that gives us sort of when it's a getting the decrement of that helps improving the incremental years i mean that would depend on the recovery on the industry so that possible to speak to the right and i guess how much on that structural yeah but yeah i'm just just eleven other point i think worth mentioning and i think what we're knowledge in here is that is this is played out in march and what we're seeing already in april read it really is hitting hitting us from mix mixed perspective hard our highest margin businesses are really feeling it here i would think that on the on the recovery we would see we would see it swing the other way when we get back and come off a bottom we should have positive mix of fact really across across the board particularly in aviation and health care your second question steve is relative to the cost actions and how much permanent how much not permanent yeah i know i guess how much is that going to cost you i mean like you know to come up with two to three billion dollars of cash you know you've done you cut your restructuring last year pretty significantly needed a couple hundred million in the first quarter i mean most companies kind of one for one what how much is this stuff going to cost you this year on a cash basis yeah i think what we have said previously we were going to be down off of last year from a from an expense and from a cash perspective i think we're probably going to end up more or less in line right keep in mind that some of the class actions like for those don't carry restructuring charged with that right because they aren't permanent so part of what we're trying to do is squeeze out some of the temporary cost but all the while if we can we can make more structural moves we want to make sure we've got room to do that but i'd say right now assume that it be relatively flat year on year but it's carolina indicated in her remarks we want to try to do more if we can great all right thanks a lot that's a lot guys thanks to u b s we have marcus better please go ahead good morning larry carlyle and let me maybe follow up on the on the good morning good morning within the year ten q you reference the numbers of forty eight percent r p k reduction and obviously dollars an r p k two different stories but if that sort of a kind of scenario that you're flying through internally and i'm just trying to get a sense what that would mean if we look at our sort of like nineteen cash as a baseline sort of like where you know on type of scenario we could end up particularly you know looking up sort of what you've mentioned in your prepared remarks that you have i think sixty two percent off of engines ahead off shop with it one which arguably are the engines that are on the narrow body coming back first because they're probably the youngest youngest in the fleet trying to get a sense of within the year how you're thinking about well i think that given what we will be highlighted relative to the april experience and the near term projection of that there's no question that we're going to continue to see the pressure on on cash and aviation that we've seen here late right now that will be our undoubtedly our biggest headwind not sure but you know you know heard sort of that the numbers that you that you said but did you do sort of internal internal stress test around where you could end up with but it's not just something that you say it's too early to comment no no no there's there's plenty there's plenty of planning for again a an extended slowdown here we're bracing this reality to the fullest extent possible we are not expecting this to bounce back in the near term so we flag in the q the i out of numbers we also reference others you see it in our own departure data here in april right we are we are way down that has a direct the in the shop visits c s a billing and the like so we're adapting to this new environment confident that it will recover we're simply not trying to assume that the pressure abates any time soon witness the cost in the cash actions that were taken sure okay and i appreciate that and maybe i'll follow up quickly on the capital side do you anticipate any change in the in the capital support therefore for insurance in particular you reference that a little bit in the prepared remarks i think two billion it's sort of the current number you thinking about that at the moment on the parent support to capital insurance let's let's take a step back then so in nineteen the capital had an infusion from four billion the estimate for for this year is two billion on insurance funding and those two billion you know that's significantly lower than before we estimated that the parent will need to support roughly in line with this some variables are still open and that depends on the capital itself right to capital earnings capital ending asset eleven but basically it's about two billion as it looks now and i would also say going forward because we do continue to spit further funding and that would be against a combination of the captain itself with their assets liquidity and their future earnings and on top of that possible captain contributions from jank you from cohen and company we have a quite time please go ahead yeah thank you good morning guys good morning question to question morning at aviation it sounds like you guys acknowledge that on the way up the spares business the aftermarket the fifteen billion dollars commercial aftermarket business will lag growth because of you know a younger fleet emerging you know a surge of use serviceable material and the like part out and obviously lower spares provisioning as the o e rates come down thirty to fifty percent i guess first question is when do you anticipate aviation free cash flow getting to break even is it even possible before calendar twenty two in that and type of environment and then i have a follow up i'm not not sure we would buy into the premise per se right i mean we are a cycles business much more so than any other indicator and those cycles are going to have to come back before the passengers do indicate the age of the fleet will will help us over time there could be some short term head wins but we'll see how that plays out i think what we're acknowledging here is that we've been hit from a free cash perspective in our biggest and best cash generator at aviation but we're really not getting into much more much more in terms of the precache forecast on a multi year basis it's just too soon there's just too many moving pieces for us to to be that forward leaning at this point we wish we could be just not where we are ok and just a follow up you know obviously two thousand and twenty is a tough year we're going to have some cash burn two thousand and twenty one unclear but certainly doesn't seem like in aviation we're going to have a strong recovery any so as we emerge from this we're going to have you know more leverage and i guess the question is you guys have made some asset sales to the leverage what else besides cost reduction can you do to get the balance sheet better faster is there any other things that you guys are exploring or that you might explore that's different than what you've done over the past year thank you well i would made that i'm not sure i would say that there's a lot that is please carolina and i was going to say that to do things that we try and i would say happen of years yeah well i would just i would just say it a high level we are committed to our de leveraging target of less than two and a half times on the industrial side and i think you've seen us make a lot of progress here to date which i hope underscores the seriousness of that objective both on the g e side right seven billion debt reductions in the quarter and that capital and it's up to ten on it on a year to day basis given given some of the things we did in april clearly it's going to take us a while longer here to hit those targets like i suspect most most companies but in terms of doing anything new or different they were going to continue to try to run these businesses as best we can be as disciplined as we can on the capital front be smart and thoughtful relative to some of the other obligations like pension as you've seen as relative to the plan design and some of the settlement options so i'm not sure they're necessarily new place per se but will continue to look at every and every option available to continue to strengthen the company strengthen the balance sheet bring those leverage levels down in the face of coba nineteen caroline i'm sorry or i jumped in there did anything dad there i would just add that to the leverage comment also the liquidity that at times like this you know you don't look at the liquidity and i think it's important to say that you want to maintain a high level of custom act my flexibility and you have been the de risking activities that we have made to sort of push out the debt for the us so we keep optional thing thank you yeah and i and i but i but i think that admin it's just important for us all to remember we ended the quarter but forty seven billion of liquidity on the back of the bio pharma action and some of the other things that we have done so it will continue to be numb and flexible mindful of our obligations and our reality from berkeley's we have julian mitchell please go ahead hi good morning maybe just a question good morning maybe just the first question around the the working capital dynamics and the free cash flow at aviation i guess you know there's a lot of industrial businesses where when you get this rapid sales downtroft you get a working capital cash offset to an extent and then it reverses", "wer": 0.32689912826899126,

As a result of the size of the Cytiva acquisition and its impact on Danaher's overall core revenue growth profile starting with the second quarter of 2020 we intend to present core revenue growth on a basis that includes Cytiva as if the business had been owned for the current period and the comparable prior year period With that I'd like to turn the call over to Tom Thanks Matt and good morning everyone I'd like to start off today by recognizing our associates around the world for their dedication and invaluable contributions during this unprecedented time Their response to the COVID-19 pandemic has been humbling and inspiring They're working tirelessly to ensure our facilities are up and running so that we can continue to provide customers with the tools necessary to carry out their essential work Our suppliers have also been incredibly supportive as this crisis has enfolded Every one of our associates customers and business partners is making a difference today And I'm incredibly grateful for their collective efforts Given how top of mind the impact of the virus is we thought we would structure the call a little differently this quarter Before we run through our first quarter results I'll highlight a number of our innovative solutions that are part of the direct response helping to fight COVID-19 .I'll provide a recap of the trends we saw across our end markets through the month of April And I'll wrap up with a few words on our announcement about the upcoming CEO transition At Danaher we're incredibly fortunate to navigate these tur- these turbulent times from a position of strength with a resilient portfolio of businesses an extremely talented team and the Danaher business system is our driving force These recent events have certainly presented a number of unforeseen challenges across our businesses but they've also created opportunities for us to support our customers and the global community in the unprecedented fight against COVID-19 We're proud to support frontline healthcare providers with much needed diagnostic testing capabilities today And to support the pursuit of new treatments and vaccines for the future As we collectively strive to contain this now no- novel virus diagnostic testing provides essential information to help us better understand and ultimately curb the spread of COVID-19 IDT was an early leader in this effort as their primer and probe kits provide a key detection component in COVID-19 diagnostic tests To date IDT has shipped kits to enable more than 30 million diagnostic tests for the virus In March Cepheid launched the first rapid molecular test related to COVID-19 that provides highly accurate results within 45 minutes With a leading global install base of more than 23,000 molecular diagnostic instruments including 5,000 in the US Cepheid tests are being deployed on the front lines to test patients and protect healthcare workers Since Cepheid test became available the team has shipped approximately 2 million test cartridges and going forward we now expect to be able to ship approximately six million tests per quarter greatly exceeding our initial expectations Recently published independent studies indicate that Cepheid test performance is best in class versus other point of care platforms on the market today providing superior virus detection with one of the fastest time to results The market leading caliber of Cepheid's test combined with their significant production ramp up is a testament to this innovative team's commitment to tackle this global health crisis head-on At Beckman Coulter diagnostics the team announced that it is developing assays to identify antibodies to the virus We expect these antibody assays will play a critical role in understanding immunity and in turn improving the world's ability to manage COVID-19 going forward Beckman will be launching one of these assays shortly a high sensitivity automated IgG serology test The team plans to ramp production capability to more than two million tests in may and over 30 million tests per month by the end of June This assay will be able to run on Beckman's global installed base of more than 16,000 immunoassay analyzers As we look ahead toward potential new therapeutics and vaccines for COVID-19 Pall and Cytiva are supporting biotech researchers and manufacturers around the world who are working tirelessly to find a cure Pall's filtration solutions are designed into the bioproduction process of multiple leading vaccine candidates and Cytiva is supporting numerous vaccine programs in development providing specific prototype affinity resins and helping them prepare to scale up production volumes These are just a few examples of how we're helping to accelerate our customer's important pursuit of COVID-19 testing treatment prevention and ultimately a cure Speaking of Cytiva I wanna take this opportunity to officially welcome the team to Danaher We're thrilled to have them on board With the addition of Cytiva we've doubled our annual revenue in the highly attractive biopharmaceutical end market to more than five billion dollars which represents approximately 50% of our life science platforms annual revenue With a more comprehensive offering across the entire bioproduction workflow we're better able to support our customers who are working to deliver more life-saving drugs faster and at a lower cost an important endeavor that's certainly accentuated by today's global health crisis Cytiva is off to a great start here in 2020 and achieved approximately 10% revenue growth in its first quarter Given the significance of the acquisition to our operating results we will include Cytiva's performance as part of our overall core growth revenue metric beginning in the second quarter So now let's take a look at our first quarter results Sales grew 3% to $4.3 billion driven by four and a half percent core revenue growth The impact of foreign currency translation decreased revenues by one and a half percent Geographically high single digit revenue growth in the developed markets was partially offset by high single digit declines in high growth markets Revenue in China was down more than 25% as a result of extensive shutdowns related to COVID-19 While January and February were solid across North America and Western Europe we saw a downturn in demand toward the end of the quarter when the pandemic became more severe across these regions Gross profit margin for the first quarter was 56.2% and operating profit margin was 16.1% adjusted diluted net earnings per common share were $1.05 We generated $694 million of free cashflow a 21% increase year over year helping to support our strong financial position Now we'll take a more detailed look at the results across the portfolio Life science reported revenue increased one and a half percent with core revenue growth of two and a half percent led by high single digit or better core revenue growth at Pall IDT and Beckman life sciences The global effort to develop COVID-19 related testing and treatment drove demand for our bioprocessing genomic and automation solutions That strong performance was partially offset by declines in our more instrument-oriented businesses Leica Microsystems and SCIEX which were negatively impacted by deferrals of large capital equipment purchases This dynamic was particularly acute in academic research as most of these labs around the world remained closed due to COVID-19 related shutdowns Moving to diagnostics reported revenue was up six percent with eight percent core revenue growth led by very strong results in our point of care businesses Cepheid and Radiometer Cepheid achieved more than 40% core revenue growth with broad-based strength across all major product lines and geographies Particular strengths in Cepheid's flu assay was driven by the combination of a more severe flu season and increased testing during the Coronavirus outbreak We also saw early strong demand for Cepheid's COVID-19 test which received USFDA emergency use authorization at the end of March Our Radiometer business achieved high teens core revenue growth Surges in hospitalized patients being treated treated for COVID-19 drove demand for Radiometer's blood gas instruments and tests a key parameter to monitor in critically ill patients With the largest global install base of blood gas instruments Radiometer's well-positioned to support clinicians and patients through this unprecedented healthcare challenge and beyond Beckman Coulter diagnostics core revenue decreased mid single digits Solid performance in North America and Western Europe was offset by significant declines in China as a result of the extensive shutdowns initiated in January These containment measures resulted in very few patients going to hospitals for treatments or procedures that were not COVID not related to COVID-19 which greatly reduced core laboratory testing volumes Moving to our environmental and applied solutions segment Reported revenue increased one percent with two and a half percent core revenue growth In our water quality platform mid single digit core revenue growth was led by double digit core revenue growth at ChemTreat Our water businesses provide essential products and solutions used to test and treat water around the world A mission critical service in any economic environment Good demand for our consumables and chemistries continued while equipment sales declined toward the end of the quarter as the broader macro uncertainty prompted many customers and municipalities to postpone larger expenditures Core revenue at our product identification platform was down low single digits with growth in marking and coding offset by declines in our packaging solutions businesses At Videojet equipment sales were down but we saw a strong demand for consumables across consumer packaged goods medical and food and beverage end markets as widespread shelter in place orders drove a surge in consumer purchases So the first quarter was challenging on many fronts but we believe that the combination of our outstanding teams DBS driven execution and differentiated portfolio enabled Danaher to outperform on a relative basis So moving on to what we saw in April the trends across our end markets through the month were largely a continuation of the dynamics that began to take hold during the last few weeks of March We continued to see a bifurcation across our life science end markets COVID-19 related research and development increased significantly over the last 60 days among our pharmaceutical and biotech customers particularly in areas like antiviral therapies vaccine development and immune response research and testing In turn this generated strong demand for our bioprocessing genomic and automation solutions Good momentum also continued for other non COVID-19 related bioprocessing driving demand for filtration chromatography single use and cell and gene therapy products However most academic research labs in the US and Europe remained closed and labs in China have only recently started to reopen These closures have resulted in significant installation delays for existing instrument orders And it appears that customers are holding off on new capital purchases until the labs reopen and they fully return to work Looking across clinical diagnostics we continued to see very strong demand through April for molecular point of care and acute care testing which is also driving increased instrument placements globally This contrasted with lower activity in hospital labs and reference labs where the significant declines in elective procedures emergency department visits and wellness checks continue to negatively impact testing volumes We also saw delayed orders and deferred new spending on larger capital equipment in these labs In the applied markets the divergence of demand between consumables and equipment persisted through April Consumables remain solid as customers sustained essential business operations like testing and treating water and safety packaging consumer product goods and medicine but equipment purchases are being delayed as mission critical operating expenses are prioritized over larger capital investments The cadence of these end market dynamics appears to be consistent with the spread of the virus with the negative impact in North America and Western Europe trailing that of China China gradually improved in April as lockdowns were lifted and businesses started to reopen and revenue growth was slightly better than initial expectations heading into the quarter In North America and Western Europe we believe that the clients are beginning to stabilize and expect modest sequential improvements over the next few months as these regions begin to gradually reopen In light of these recent trends we expect second quarter core revenue growth including Cytiva to be in the range of flat to down 10% So to wrap up as I reflect on the events of the last few months I am humble by our team's dedication an innovative response to this unprecedented crisis True to our core values our associates are listening to our customers and innovating to help address their toughest challenges Never before have these challenges been more collectively urgent and abundant and I'm so proud of how our associates have risen to the occasion Looking ahead we feel very well positioned to navigate through this uncertain environment We believe that the combination of our outstanding portfolio exceptional team DBS-driven execution will continue to differentiate Danaher in 2020 and beyond Now before we go to Q&A I wanna address the press release that went out last night regarding our upcoming CEO transition After more than 30 years at Danaher including the last six as CEO I've decided to begin the transition to retirement I do this knowing that Danaher has never been stronger The combination of our portfolio enhanced execution around innovation and our seasoned leadership team driven by the Danaher business system create a strong foundation for continued outperformance I have loved every day of the past three decades and throughout my entire Danaher career I've been privileged to be part of an incredible team I've always considered the primary responsibilities of my current role to be focused on deploying capital efficiency enhancing the portfolio driving", "pred_text": "and i will be a conference facilitator this morning at this

tremendous progress we've made on all these fronts I plan to see the corporation through the challenges of the next few months and I'm confident that our portfolio and the team are both in a fantastic position to thrive in the years to come Many of you know Rainer Blair well from his days as president of SCIEX And more recently as our EVP leading the evolution of our life science platform enhancing the platform's growth and margin profile while leading the acquisitions of Pall IDT and Cytiva to name just a few There is no question that Rainer is the right person to lead us into the future With the support of our senior leadership team and our board I'm confident that Rainer is well prepared to execute our strategic priorities and continue creating significant value for our shareholders So what's next for me Well first off that question is one for several months from now but I'm looking forward to spending more time with my family and I'll continue to serve on the boards of MedStar Health and the college of the Holy Cross I'll remain in the CEO role through September 1st of this year and I'll be around into 2021 in an advisory role but for now and as soon as we've finished this call we will be right back to work because we have a lot to do in the coming months With that I'll turn the call back over to Matt so we can start taking your questions Thanks Tom That concludes our formal comments Christelle we're now ready for questions Thank you Once again to ask a question please press star one Our first question comes from the line of Derek De Bruin with Bank of America Um hi good morning All right Derek Hey um so a couple of questions um and then uh I'll I'll congratulate you on on the retirement I'm jealous by the way Uh uh um so to start off so can you tell us what you're embedding into the guide in the 2Q for um COVID related contributions I mean you're producing a lot of Cepheid tests you know the serologies ramping um I guess are all those tests going to be used Are they all spoken for I'm just curious in terms of rigidity about utilization and sort of what's embedded into the the the guide Thanks Sure Okay Thanks Thanks Derek Uh happy to um walk you through that a bit So if let's go right to the to the COVID impact in Q2 and and I would think about it as um largely a tailwind that probably represents you know 500 basis points of uh of of of improvement or growth that's associated predominantly with Cepheid Radiometer and IDT And in terms of the related question about what's spoken for um you know Cepheid were were flat out at at Cepheid Um we are we are continuing to expand our capacity Um but every test that we produce every single day uh gets shipped and the demand is continuing to build Um Radiometer also running flat out um not quite the need for expanded capacity we had the surge capacity we needed there but they're doing exceptionally well um and IDT holding its own as well So I think overall you'd consider Cepheid Radiometer and IDT certainly um con- contributors on the positive side Um what that really means is that the rest of the portfolio is you know potentially down anywhere from five to 15% and those heavier headwinds are gonna come in businesses like like Beckman Diagnostics Leica Biosystem a bit that are more patient volume dependent And we'll have to see whether that patient volume you know coming from loosening up of electric procedures starts to return but certainly the greater bit of headwind is in the equipment oriented business like LMS and SCIEX and a and a bit of PID no doubt So now putting all that together you then partially offset that with with probably a bit of positive from Pall and Cytiva that are showing positive growth that's not exclusively COVID related but certainly uh related to the future developments around therapies and vaccines So I think that's the way I'd I'd sort of generally frame up the uh the pluses and the minuses around the COVID impact in in Q2 And that's Matt Hey Derek it's Matt I just wanna make sure also um you've kind of uh we mentioned serology We are not assuming anything here in the quarter for serology even though we're ramping up with Beckman and we're gonna have some capacity here Our view is that it's just a little too early to really kind of tell you know what the volumes might look like what uh a national testing program or any other kind of local testing programs might look like So that that COVID tailwind does not include serology just to be clear Oh great That's really helpful And I guess just one question on Cytiva um and and in general did you see any stocking in the first quarter and I'm just curious what are you assuming for organic revenue growth in the Cytiva standalone business for the second quarter Um Derek we saw uh you know very little It's always hard to tell when it's uh you know uh uh on the margins um as to whether or not there was there was stocking going on there Um you know generally we don't don't think it was particularly material but I tell you Cytiva is off to a great start As I mentioned a 10% 10% core growth in the first quarter really strong momentum in the core bio-processing uh business And and and that's really driven by folks working on solutions to to COVID-19 Um and but you know as we look forward I think we we we have really as you can imagine just closed the the the uh the end of March 1st of April Um we're just getting in there to really understand what that funnel looks like And you know there's there's plenty of uncertainties about um how much that volume will build over time depending on the the pro- progression of therapies and vaccines So I think we've got an outstanding start here but um you know in terms of w- where we are from a guide perspective on Cytiva we're we're still trying to size up what that backlog is starting to look like Um obviously we haven't even gotten face to face with the team yet from an operating review standpoint given the uh the the limitations we here have here on travel So right now we're gonna focus on obviously a good deal of rebranding work that we need to do Um we're gonna stand it up as a standalone operating company execute on the TSA and exit those TSA uh work streams and costs and make sure that we're embedding DBS into those into the business and and working on opportunities to continue to improve its performance So we'll we'll come we'll come back to you and give you a better sense of what Cytiva looks like uh in the balance of the year Once we get a little bit more stability here in terms of uh how the how the bookings trends look and uh uh we round the corner here coming into the second half of the year Great Thank you Thanks Derek Your next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson with JP Morgan Good morning Tycho Okay Thanks Good morning Uh Tom I'll start with the congrats on the transition It I think it might be helpful to hear from you why why now is the right time I know you you plan these things out well in advance but you know I think people were caught a little bit off guard in the middle of a pandemic after closing your largest deals So could you maybe just talk a little bit about you know how long this transition had been planned and why now is the right time Sure absolutely Tycho I'd be happy to Um you know I I can honestly say that you you had to you would have to go all the way back to um my very first year uh in the role where uh we uh along with the board made sure that we talked about talent development about ensuring that we are um progressing in various ways through our leadership ranks to get to the point where we are today and and and had an outstanding choice in Rainer Blair um to succeed me So this has very much been um the culmination of a succession planning process that really has gone on over the last uh over the last five or six years Um we we always wanted to to do something like this when we're in a in a position of strength And I think the combination of where we are with the portfolio and our performance where we are around driving innovation and growth and the strength of our team and talent really is what I I think makes us very comfortable that that this is certainly a good time um to turn the reins over It was super important that we got Cytiva closed and um and that we gave ourselves time to ensure that the transition here um of the role um allows for both Rainer and I to to uh contribute to ensuring that Cytiva comes into the organization um smoothly So um I think it's really a combination of all those things Um you know I think the the the the Danaher board was uh incredibly supportive and constructive around this all along I am uh I am really excited about about Rainer and um the the talent and the capabilities that he brings to this role And uh he's just gonna do a fantastic job So um we uh we all feel great about it Okay Thanks And then for the followup just a question on uh on some of the longer term uh COVID related uh tailwinds You know for Cepheid there are presumably be less rule in rule out you know flu testing uh tied to COVID going forward So I'm curious how you think about that and then how you think about durability of that test once uh there is a vaccine on the market For Beckman curious if you can put anything around pricing uh for serology And then lastly for Cytiva and Pall just curious how meaningful you think vaccine and therapy development could be for those businesses you know on a multi-year basis Thanks Sure Thanks Tycho Um you know there's uh we've got a lot going on as it uh as it relates to the the future um impacts of COVID And I think in many respects we're pretty uniquely positioned both on the short term and the long term Um I think if you start with from a diagnostic testing perspective um Cepheid's impact along with IDT Radiometer in terms of treatment on the front line um as well as Beckman in in serology and Ig- IgG testing I think that that's a pretty unique combination of capabilities Now you asked about the durability of the Cepheid test I think um you know as you know well we are one of the world leaders in flu testing and I think as we see the future here you're gonna you're gonna look clinicians are gonna be look-looking for the opportunity in doing flu testing to also be doing COVID-19 testing And I think the ability to run those tests on the same platform in the same cartridge same cartridge configuration um is a real advantage and a real opportunity we have uh for Cepheid Of course this this surge in demand now is happening We're seeing that not only in terms of the test cartridges themselves but it's driving um a significant increase in our install base And so in that install base has grown you're also gonna see that install base driving not only COVID-19 testing but just continuing to support expanded flu testing and market share gains for Cepheid over time And obviously there's a broader suite of tests that run on the Cepheid architecture and so that's gonna benefit as well So we think there's exceptional durability um to uh to the the Cepheid architecture in an environment even in one where we have and and God willing we will have both therapies as well as uh as well as vaccines Um in terms of your your question about Beckman and serology you know I think the we the way we see serology evolving over time is you're it's gonna be primarily driven obviously with the blood draw and you're gonna see the serology test the IgG tests integrated into more routine testing and therefore um the cost per test is gonna be quite reasonable Um and it's gonna be in line with other immunoassay tests And uh so we talk about the the capacity to have 30 million tests as I think Matt said earlier I wouldn't build that into any models but I think it's representative of the fact that um serology testing that IgG test is gonna become more of a standard um in basic testing when it comes to uh immunoassay So I think a lot of a lot of terrific potential there particularly as it relates to advances in uh in public health and population uh testing um and some of the work that's being done by by public health authorities um to look for hotspots over time Um in terms of your question about Cytiva and um and and and work around uh therapies and vac- vaccines I'd say both Pall and Cytiva are uniquely positioned to provide you know pretty critical inputs meaning filtration and resins to both vaccine and therapeutic candidates Um right now we would estimate that they're greater than 150 therapeutic and vaccine candidates today Um and Pall and Cytiva are working with a majority of those in some capacity And uh so obviously there'll be there'll be winners and losers but we think we have a a number of of exceptional positions there with uh with folks that are likely gonna be part of the future therapy um and or um vaccine uh answers So I think a good good spot to be in Great I appreciate it And congrats again on the retirement Thanks Tycho Your next question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI Morning Vijay Um morning guys and Tom uh congrats on a on a well earned uh rest Um I think uh you know maybe starting with the leadership uh question here Tom um you know you mentioned that Rainer um not not you know he's known to the street uh but uh perhaps uh you know not not everyone knows him well uh and you did mention that he was the right person Maybe contrast your leadership style versus with Rainer's leadership style Uh what what does Rainer uh bring here um you know and what should investors look forward to under this transition Sure well um I'd start uh Vijay with the fact that um Rainer and I have worked together closely um for virtually all of his his 10 years Um you know I don't know if everybody knows that when Rainer was first uh first hired um at at Danaher um he came in initially as the as the president of Videojet And I'm not sure Rainer and his wife Alaine had had actually unpacked their bags when uh we had uh we were looking to to succeed me at SCIEX After the SCIEX acquisition I was headed off to Beckman and uh we had this outstanding uh outstanding leader uh who had just come into Videojet and a real need in SCIEX and and uh Rainer uh repacked and and moved to Boston and led SCIEX for for a number of years and just did an exceptional job And and he and I have worked together literally every day since then um through the the the work at SCIEX through the acquisitions of Pall and and IDT obviously throughout the tremendous work that he did identifying the opportunity that has become Cytiva our largest acquisition ever Um and so you know when you've worked together um for as long as we have I guess there there do tend to be quite a number of similarities um about the two of us but you know Vijay you're gonna have plenty of time to uh to ask Rainer that question And he'll probably have a more thoughtful contrast between the two of us than than I will Uh he's uh he's an outstanding individual He is super smart He is steeped in in the domains um not only in life science but but across Danaher Um he's unbelievably well-respected across Danaher as a DBS leader a great teacher a DBS practitioner and somebody who lives and breathes the Danaher core values and our shared purpose of helping realize life's potential every single day Um you know his track record relative to M and A and his bias towards uh driving innovation by being willing to to to place bets um both early stage bets as well as more mature bets to drive innovation um is uh is unparalleled So I um you know I I I hope and believe that you'll probably see a lot of similarities between the two of us in terms of what we value um but uh you know Rainer we'll uh we'll put his own mark on Danaher and I am supremely confident that that mark on Daneber Danaher is gonna be an outstanding one and an indelible one That's helpful perspective Tom Uh just maybe uh one uh housekeeping uh you know question for perhaps for Matt Matt I think um you know the press release had a couple of hundred basis points that contribution from Cytiva um that perhaps in place uh you know double digits maybe even low teens growth in the business I just wanna make sure with the business doing 10% I think in that Q1 uh you know continuing double digits in that 2Q uh is that just uh the business uh you know um growth as usual or was there any contribution perhaps from uh you know COVID related business and then perhaps also address uh you know margins here for 2Q Thanks guys Yeah sure So from a Cytiva perspective I mean I think you know it grew 10% there in Q1 I think that's probably a reasonable place you know for the business to be here in the second quarter as well So I think your your math on that is is pretty correct Um as far as decremental margins go I think um the place that I'd start is probably about 40% uh decremental It can vary you know quite a bit depending on mix et cetera but I think starting with 40 is a good place to start Um I will tell you that uh you probably in in Q2 in diagnostics though probably need to be more like 50 or 60% decrementals and that's all related to FX So that Delta will be because of FX here in the quarter So 40 overall maybe a touch higher here in Q2 in in diagnostics Thanks guys Thanks Vijay We have reached the allotted time for questions Your last question comes from the line of Scott Davis with Melius Research Hey good morning guys and congrats Tom Thanks Scott Good morning It's been a great six years I we um I'm a little surprised you're you're gone but I don't blame you It's uh retirement sounds pretty interesting right now Scott it was it was it was not informed by the current", "pred_text": "and developing town and i can now look back fondly on the tremendous progress we've made on all these fronts i plan to see the

we have a lot to do in the coming months with that i'll turn the call back over to matt so we can start taking questions thanks to concludes our formal comments christ we're now ready for questions thank you once again to ask a question please press star one first question comes from the line of direct everyone with bank of america hi good morning hate so a couple of questions and then congratulate you on the retirement i'm jealous by the way so to start off so can you tell us what you're embedding into the guide in the two q for cobid related contributions i mean you're producing a lot of sepia test you know the sera these ramping i guess are all those tests going to be used are they all spoken for this is curious in terms of getting about utilization and there are what's embedded into the guide thanks sure ok thanks thanks derek happy to walk you through that a bit so if let's go right to the to the covet impact to in the end i would think about it as largely a tail wind that probably represents you know five hundred basis points of improvement or growth that associated predominantly with sepi it radiometer and i d t and in terms of the related question about what spoken for you know sepi and we're flat out at separate we are we are continuing to expand our capacity but every test that we produce every single day get shipped and demand is continuing to build radiometer also running flat out not quite that need for expanded capacity we had the surge capacity we needed there but they're doing exceptionally well and i d p holding its own as well so i think overall you consider sepi a radiometer and i d t certainly contributors on the positive side what that really means is that the rest of the portfolio is you know potentially down anywhere from five to fifteen percent and those heavier headwinds are going to come in businesses like like that in diagnostics like the biosystems a bit that are more patient volume dependent and we'll have to see whether that patient volume you know coming from loosening up of elective procedures starts to return but certainly the greater bit of headwind is in the equipment oriented business like alam s and a bit of p id no doubt so now putting all that together you then partially offset that with probably a bit of positive from paul and site that are showing positive growth that not exclusively cope with related but certainly related to the future developments around therapies and vaccines so i think that's the way i sort of generally frame up the pluses in the minuses around the covered impact in q two and there and that it's matt it's not as one make sure also kind of we mentioned serology we are not assuming anything here in the quarter for sera g even though we're ramping up with back minutes we're going to have some capacity here our view is that it's just a little too early to really kind of tell you know what the volumes might look like what a national testing program or any other kind of local testing programs might look like so that that covered tailwind does not include just to be clear great that's really helpful and i guess what just one question on in general did you see any stocking in the first quarter and i'm just curious what do you win sum for gannett revenue growth in the psyche the standalone business for the second you know very little it's always hard to tell when it's you know on the margins as to whether or not there was there was stocking going on there you know generally we don't don't think it was particularly material but i tell you a great start as i mentioned ten percent ten percent core growth in the first quarter really strong momentum in the core bio processing business and that's really driven by folks working on solutions to covid nineteen and but you know as we look forward i think we have really as you can imagine can we just close the end of march first of april we're just getting in there to really understand what that bundle looks like and you know there's plenty of uncertainties about how much that volume will build over time depending on the progression of therapies and vaccine so i think we've got an outstanding start here but you know in terms of where we are from a guide perspective on site we're still trying to size up what that backlog is starting to look like obviously we haven't even gotten face to face with the team yet from an operating review standpoint given the limitations we hear have here on travel so right now we're going to focus on obviously a good deal of rebranding work that we need to do we're

stability here terms of the bookings trend look and we round the corner here coming into the second half of the year great thank you thanks dear your next question comes from the line tyco peterson with j p morgan morning tyco thanks good morning tom i will start with congrats on the transition it i think it might be helpful to hear from you why why now is the right time i know you plan these things out well in advance but you know i think people caught a little bit off guard in the middle of a pandemic after closing your largest deals who could you maybe just talk a little bit about you

excited about about reiner and the talent capabilities that he brings to this role and he's just going to do a fantastic job so we we all feel great about it ok thanks and then for the follow up just a question on some of the longer term coded related tailwinds you know for sefi and they're presumed to be less ruling rule out you know flu testing tied to kobe going forward so i'm curious how you think about that and then i think about durability of that test once there is a vaccine on the market for back being curious if you can put anything around pricing person ology and then lastly for site and paul just curious how meaningful you think vaccine therapy development could be for those businesses you know on a multi year basis thanks sure thanks tyco you know there's we've got a lot going on as it as it relates to the future impacts of covet and i think in many respects we're pretty uniquely positioned both on the short term and the long term i think if you start with from a diagnostic testing perspective sepi its impact along with i d t radiometer in terms of treatment on the front line as well as backman and sergey and i g i g testing i think that's a pretty unique combination of capabilities now you asked about the durability of the sepia test i think you know as you know well we are one of the world leaders in flu testing and i think as we see the future here you're going to you're going to look clinicians are going to be look looking for the opportunity in doing blue testing to also be doing coba nineteen testing and i think the ability to run those tests on the same platform in the same card the same card configuration is a real advantage and a real opportunity we have perception demand now is happening we're seeing that not only in terms of the test cartridges themselves but it's driving a significant increase in our install base and so is that install base is grown you're also going to see that install base driving not only cobbler nineteen testing but continuing to support expanded flu testing and market share gains percept over time and obviously there's a broader suite of tests that run on the sepiate architecture and so that's going to benefit as well so we think there's exceptional durability to sepiate architecture in an environment even in one where we have and god willing we will have both therapies as well as as well as back seen in terms of your question about back minutes or ology you know i think the we way we see surrogate evolving over time is it's going to be primarily driven obviously with a blood drop and you're going to see the role of g test the i g test integrated into more routine testing and therefore the cost per test is going to be quite reasonable and it's going to be in line with other amino acid test and so we talk about the capacity to have thirty million test as i think matt said earlier wouldn't build that into any models but i think it's representative of the fact that testing that i g test is going to become more standard in basic testing when it comes to so i think a lot of a lot of terrific potential there particularly as it relates to advances in public health and population testing and some of the work that's being done by public health authorities to look for hotspots over time in terms of your question about and work around therapies and by vaccines i'd say both paul and site are uniquely positioned to provide you know pretty critical input meaning filtration and resins to both vaccine and therapeutic candidates right now we would estimate that there are greater than one hundred and fifty therapeutic and vaccine candidates today and paul inside are working with a majority of those in some capacity and so obviously they'll be winners and losers but we think we have a number of exceptional positions there with folks that are likely going to be part of the future therapy and or vaccine answers so i think good good spot to be in great i appreciate it and congrats again on the retirement thanks very next question comes from the line of v j kamar with ever quarrel i ass i morning b j morning guys congrats and well learned i think you know maybe starting with the leadership question here tom you know you mention a brainer not you know he's known to the street perhaps not everyone knows him well and he did mention that he was the right person maybe contrast your leadership style with that rainer leadership style what does rainer bring here you know and what should investors look forward to under this transition sure well i start b j with the fact that reiner and i have worked together closely for virtually all of his ten years you know i don't know if everybody knows that when when reiner was first first hired at danny her he came in initially as the as the president of video jet and i'm not sure writer and his wife elaine it actually unpacked their bags when we had we were looking to succeed me at siacks after the psychosis and i was headed off to back men and we had this outstanding standing leader just come into video jet a real needed side accent and writer repacked and moved to boston and led si x for a number of years and just did an exceptional job and he and i have worked together literally every day since then through the work of siack through the acquisitions of paul and i d t obviously throughout the tremendous work that he did identifying the opportunity that has become site our largest acquisition ever and so you know when you work together for as long as we have i guess there do tend to be quite a number of similarities about the two of us but you know b j you can have plenty of time to ask reiner that question he'll probably have a more thoughtful contrast between the two of us than i will he's an outstanding individual he is super smart he is deep in the domain not only in life science but but across dana her he's unbelievably well respected across dana her at the d b s leader a great teacher a d b s practitioner and somebody who lives and breathes the danner core values and our shared purpose of helping realize life potential every single day you know his track record relative to m n a and his bias towards driving innovation by being willing to place bets early stage bats as well as more mature bets to drive innovation is unparalleled so i you know i hope and believe that you'll probably see a lot of similarities between the two of us in terms of what we value but you know reiner will put his own mark on danna her and i am supremely confident that that mark on dana bergen her going to be an outstanding one and an indelible one that's helpful perspective tom just maybe one housekeeping you know question for perhaps from that matt you know the pressure lease had a couple of hundred basis points contribution from psyche that perhaps implies you know double digits maybe even low teens growth in the business i just want to make sure with the business doing ten percent i think in that q one in a continuing double digits and to q is that just the business you know growth as usual or was there any contribution perhaps from a code related business and then perhaps also address going to detrimental margins here for two thanks guys so even perspective i mean i think you know you grew ten percent there in key one i think that's probably a reasonable place you know for the business to be here in the second quarter as well so i think your math on that is pretty correct as far as detrimental margins go i think the place that i'd start is probably about forty percent decrementals it can vary you know quite a bit depending on mix etc but i think starting with forty is a good place to start i will tell you that probably in q two in diagnostics though probably need to be more like or sixty percent decrementals and that's all related to so that delta will be because of effects here in the corner so forty overall may be a touch higher here in q two and in diagnosis thanks we have reached the allotted time for questions your last question comes from the line at scott davis with millions research good morning guys and grass tom thanks god good morning

the conference over to Scott Dudley Managing Director Investor Relations Please go ahead Thank you Good morning and welcome to our second quarter earnings call We issued our earnings news release this morning and you may access it on our website at spireenergy.com under newsroom There's a slide presentation that accompanies our webcasts and you may lo- download it either from the webcast site or from our website under investors and then events and presentations Presenting on the call today are Suzanne Sitherwood president and CEO Steve Lindsey Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer and Steve Rasche Executive Vice President and CFO Before we begin let me cover our safe harbor statement and use of non- GAAP earnings measures Today's call including responses to questions may contain forward looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 199 Although our forward looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions there are various uncertainties and risk factors that may cause future performance or results to be different than those anticipated These risks and uncertainties are outlined in our quarterly and annual filings with the FCC In our comments we'll be discussing net economic earnings contribution margin adjusted EBITDA and adjusted longterm capitalization which are all non-gap measures used by management when evaluating our performance and results of operations explanations and reconciliations of these measures to their gap counterparts are contained in our news release and a slide presentation So with that I will turn the call over to Suzanne Thank you Scott and good morning to everyone joining us for our second quarter update I'd like to begin by acknowledging that we're all adjusting to a new normal As we focus on staying safe and healthy during the coronavirus we're living in a world of video calls FaceTime webcasts working from home wearing face masks and washing our hands a lot And we're connecting in new ways Like you many of us aren't in our offices and aren't able to see one another face to face In fact today is the second time in nearly two months that Steve Rasche Steve Lindsey and I have been in the same location Rest assured that we're distancing and disinfecting and getting the job done It's not easy to stay connected in times like this at Spire connecting with us should feel like a handshake at the front door But without the ability to actually shake someone's hand we found ourselves leaning into other expressions of caring and friendship like how we listen how we check on our elderly neighbors how we smile and wave for load of strangers It's how our crews stop work take off their hats and put their hands over the heart when a funeral procession drives by These moments of connection and curing inspire the good in all of us and provide the energy it takes to walk through a time like this A time when some communities are impacted more than others but none go untouched A time when we understand how essential are services and how people count on us to deliver A time when safety has an expanded meaning and personal protective equipment becomes an everyday necessity But at Spire it's easier for us to pivot We have a very clear mission that guides us answer every challenge advance every community and enrich every life through the strength of our energy You see we believe we are called to answer this and every challenge that arises We know that people rely on our energy every day and that we are an essential service We know that we cannot let our customers and communities down And we know that safety is a core value a value at the heart of every decision It's because of this deeply held belief that we set in motion a broad range of protective steps to address the coronavirus health crisis and its economic impact on our customers while passionately protecting the health and safety of our employees and communities We began in early March by activating our incident support team or the IST a cross-functional team of 25 leaders from operations and all our shared services The IST has been meeting nearly every morning to discuss challenges solve issues and coordinate actions from HR policies to supply chain access to PPE and impact to employees customers and operations By the middle of March we activated the highest level of our crisis response plan by convening our Crisis Management Team or CMT I asked Steve Lindsey to lead this team aspiring chief operating officers Steve immediately gathered all of our chief officers and business unit presidents to quickly make executive decisions around broad ranging challenges Steve will talk more about this in a moment From my perspective I like to say that it's been inspiring to watch the ISG and CMT work Together we bring a collection of expertise to our conversations from the very professional perspective of Spire's leadership to our external involvement with the American Gas Association and our firsthand conversations with medical experts via the many hospital boards we serve on Together we are careful to balance the needs of our many stakeholders including you We are communicating early and often with all employees and customers We are connecting regularly with our board and keeping our governors legislators and regulators informed every step of the way Most importantly the CMT is keenly aware of the impact our decisions have on people and everything we do our goal is to flatten the curve and help control the spread of coronavirus while safely and reliably providing energy for our customers and communities Thank goodness our largest operations are in Missouri and Alabama areas of the country that have been minimally impacted by the pandemic In fact only 11 of our 3,500 employees have tested positive for the coronavirus and all but one person is back to work So as we work to meet the challenges created by the coronavirus we remain focused on our strategy to deliver growth and value by growing organically investing in infrastructure and advancing through innovation We continue to take steps to ensure that we remain strong both financially and from an operations perspective We'll hear more on that from Steve and Steve when they discuss our capital spending including investments in new business and infrastructure upgrades as well as our updated CapEx forecast that supports our longterm growth outlook As reported in our earnings announcement this morning our second quarter net economic earnings per share was below last year and our FY20 plan As Steve Rasche will discuss in more detail the results were driven by lower margins due to warmer weather across our footprint margins that were not fully mitigated by a regulatory mechanism However our results were minimally impacted by the coronavirus And finally we'll spend some time updating you on our process as we continue to pursue favorable regulatory outcomes across our jurisdiction with the focus on and filings in Missouri With that I'll turn the call over to Steve Lindsey to discuss our results and coronavirus responses in more detail Thank you Suzanne I wanna begin by acknowledging the outstanding efforts of our employees during the difficult times brought on by the coronavirus and the resulting economic shutdown You're providing great service for our customers while taking extra care to ensure their health safety and wellbeing as well as your own and helping support our communities in this time of need And we all thank you very much Suzanne mentioned we quickly activated the CMT with 10 primary areas of focus This morning I'd like to take a moment to outline the steps we've taken to address the coronavirus its impact on three of those areas our employees customers and communities Keeping these stakeholders healthy safe and supportive is more than a priority for us it's a core value It's who we are at Spire For our employees we have educated everyone on healthy practices and encourage people to follow the advice of the experts including the CDC and other public health organizations Our guidelines include staying home when not feeling well frequent hand-washing social distancing and other best practices We implemented policies to help employees handle the impacts of the coronavirus including taking care of family members or dealing with children being home from school An example of this is the implementation of our emergency leave program For field workers and technicians we have taken extra safety precautions to protect them and our customers We pre-screen a customer's premise to ensure that no one is sick or symptomatic before we allow our workers to enter a home or business And we equip our employees with personal protective equipment For our office-based employees we implemented a work from home policy starting in March and extending through May along with work from home and social distancing we've also implemented related policies to eliminate all non-essential travel as well as group meetings and gatherings And across our company we stepped up the frequency of cleaning and sanitizing our work locations Currently we're developing work transition plans that include reopening offices and facilities For our customers we are first and foremost focused on making sure they're well-served and that they continue to grow and then we continue to provide safe and reliable energy that they've come to rely on regardless regardless of the situation at hand To help reduce customer contact and limit the potential for spreading the illness postpone work that wasn't time critical or urgent And to help our customers through what is surely a difficult time financially we work with our regulators to suspend involuntary disconnections and late fees through the end of May Also expanding customer bill assistance programs As a company we have pledged $500,000 matching gifts to augment the contributions made by customers and employees into our dollar health program Thousands of customers have already signed up to give and their match gifts total more than $300,000 so far Similarly we have donated $250,000 to local area food pantries and meal programs From Alabama to Wyoming we're helping provide about 650,000 meals for families struggling to make ends meet during this time We also led an effort with other companies to donate and set up laptops for children in limited income schools so they're able to learn from home Since we're all in this together we've been coordinating and staying in close communications with various state and local government bodies healthcare organizations and industry groups to ensure that we are doing the most good by leveraging our collective energy and resources While we've been hard at work to address the impacts of the coronavirus and serve our customers well we've also remained focused on our business objectives centered on growing our company We continue to invest in organic growth and infrastructure upgrades across our utilities For the first half of fiscal 2020 we invested $53 million in new business keeping up keeping pace with last year's record levels of investment and new premise activations As you can see our investment and our utilities is is expanding Year-to-date we've invested $279 million focused on new business and pipeline replacement That's up $24 million or nearly 10% for the first half of last year On the gas-related business side our spend is actually down year-over-year largely reflecting the completion of the Spire STL pipeline For the full year of fiscal 2020 we've increased our planned capital spend to $640 million up $30 million from our prior forecasted investment About 88% of our 2020 spin will be on our gas utilities with two thirds of the increase or about $20 million attributable to utility investment We also plan to invest $10 million in the third quarter at Spires storage Regulatory mechanisms we have including incentives to accelerate system upgrades in Missouri and Alabama and realtime brick-making in Alabama are key to timely recovery and support infrastructure modernization earnings growth and better environmental performance to reduce methane emissions As you know from our discussion last quarter in Missouri we have been working through a number of cases decided by the Missouri Public Service Commission going back to 2016 that had been challenged and appealed by the Office of Public Counsel and resulted in adverse appellate court rulings late last year At the time of the appeal court orders we said we would pursue all avenues legislative judicial and regulatory to preserve the ability to continue investing in the safety reliability and environmental performance of our pipeline system while achieving timely recovery The start of the Missouri legislative session in January we worked to introduce bills in both the house and Senate to clarify the ISRS statute as it relates to the eligibility of infrastructure upgrade spend for accelerated recovery The Senate bill passed early March On May 6th the house passed the substitution of the Senate bill Given the differences between the versions passed in each chamber the legislation will now go to conference committee to reconcile the two versions Meanwhile we have continued to file new ISRS requests including one in early February Late last month we the staff of the Missouri Public Service Commission and the Office of Public Counsel reached the unanimous stipulation and agreement subject to Missouri PSC approval that would result in an $11 million annualized increase in ISRS revenue Regarding the cases subject to the appeals court ruling these have been remanded back to Missouri Public Service Commission for final resolution following the denial of our request for the Missouri Supreme Court review in mid-March The commission has 120 days or until the middle of July to render a decision including whether any refund is required For anyone who would like more detail on the various ISRS cases there's a table in the appendix of our slide presentation today Finally in Alabama we have been implementing new off system sales and capacity release program that went into effect December 1st We're also continuing to pursue the benefits of the Accelerated Infrastructure Modernization rider or AIM and are on track to achieve the threshold number of miles replaced this year in order to qualify for the in 2021 like we were seeing this past year With that I'll turn the call over to Steve Rasche for a financial review and update Good morning And let me add my wishes for good health and safety to everyone and a huge shout out to all of our first responders healthcare workers and our own team who continue to serve bravely every day Let me cover our quarterly results the financial impact of coronavirus and an update to our targets for the second half of our fiscal 202 Turning to our results for the quarter we delivered consolidated net economic earnings of $144 million down $3.90 million from last year Our gas utility posted earnings of just over $144 million down $2.40 million from last year as a result of warmer weather and losses on investments As marketing delivered earnings of just over $5 million down just over $1 million from last year as higher volumes from our expansion were offset by less favorable market conditions and higher costs And we saw higher earnings from the Spire STL pipeline which entered service last quarter a lower loss from fu- Spire storage reflecting the benefits of our operational improvements and slightly higher corporate costs Looking at our per share results courier earnings of $2 and 75 cents per share were down 15 cents from last year Reflecting lower earnings as well as the impact of preferred and common stock issued over the last 12 months I'd offer two additional comments First as Suzanne mentioned we saw limited financial impact from the coronavirus this quarter since it really didn't hit our service territory is in until mid-March or in the forward impact in a few minutes And secondly as reflected here net economic earnings continues to include all ISRS revenues or saying in another way excluding the provision we booked for gap purposes For this quarter ISRS revenue is subject to a provision for $2.20 million including interest Bringing the cumulative provision at March 31 to $16.90 million Overall whether this quarter was warmer than normal by 11% in Missouri and by 26% in Alabama compared to last year's colder weather we saw margins and Missouri decline by $3 million as slightly lower residential volume metric margins were offset by higher net ISRS revenues combined with a significant drop in commercial markets Our Southern utility showed margin growth as lower demand was offset by annual rate increases Margins were also significantly below our expectations of normal weather and mitigation mechanisms that offset that exposure Again in our Southern service territory's the mechanisms largely worked as planned In Missouri however we saw a $7 million negative impact to margins against normal weather consisting of two components First WNAR This new weather normalization tool was introduced in our last rate proceeding and should ensure that we get the right recovery of the residential volume metric charge not over collecting in cold periods not under collecting in warmer ones While the mechanism did address a portion of our weather deficiencies this quarter we estimate that it was ineffective by 6% or roughly $5 million Secondly we saw a short fall in commercial and industrial margins that do not have weather mitigation in Missouri even for smaller more weather sensitive customers Total impact here was about $2 million We clearly have some work to do both working with our regulators to improve the effectiveness of our weather mitigation and our next Missouri rate proceeding and two generating earnings from other sources in the back half of 2020 to offset some of this happen There were two other key variances this quarter O&M expenses and other expenses as outlined here on slide 1 Total O&M expenses as reported were down $12.60 million and although we have a history of cost control this reduction reflects the benefit of a regulatory deferral of a pension remeasured charge with the offsetting expense recorded in other expenses as shown here Excluding", "pred_text": "and welcome to the spire second quarter

capacity release program that went into effect december first also continuing to pursue the benefits of the accelerated infrastructure modernization rider a and are on track to achieve the threshold number of miles replaced this year in order to qualify for the r o yadder in two thousand and twenty one like we're seeing this past year but that i'll turn the call over to the rash for a financial review and update good morning and let me add my wishes for good health and safety to everyone and a huge shout out to all of our first responders health care workers and our own team who continue to serve bravely every day let me cover our quarterly results the financial impact of coronavirus and an update to our targets for the second half of our fiscal two thousand and twenty two our results for the quarter we delivered consolidated net economic earnings of one hundred and forty four million dollars down three point nine million dollars from last year as you told a poster during just over one hundred and forty four million dollars down two point four million dollars from last year as a result of warmer weather and losses on investments marketing deliveries are just over five dollars million down just over one billion dollars from last year as higher volumes from our expansion roughset by less favorable market conditions and higher cost and we saw higher earnings from the spire s t o pipeline which enter service last water a lower loss from foss fire storage reflecting the benefits of our operational improvements and slightly higher corporate cost looking at our per share results her earnings of two dollars seventy five cents per share went out fifteen cents from last year reflecting lower earnings as well as the impact of preferred and common stock issued over the last twelve months i offer two additional comments first as suzanne mentioned we saw a limited financial impact from the coronavirus this quarter such it really didn't hit our service territories until mid march or in the forward impact in a few minutes and secondly as reflected here economic earnings continues to include all israel's revenues or saying it another way excluding the provision we book for gap purposes for this quarter revenues subject to a provision were two million two hundred thousand dollars including interest bringing the cumulative provision at march thirty one to sixteen million nine hundred thousand dollars overall whether this water was warmer than normal by eleven percent in missouri and by twenty six percent in alabama compared to last year's colder weather we saw margins in missouri declined by three million dollars as slightly lower residential volume metric margins were offset by higher net as risk revenues combined with a significant drop in commercial margins our southern utility showed margin growth as lower demand was offset by annual rate increases margins were also significantly below our expectations of normal weather and mitigation mechanisms that offset that exposure again in our southern service territories the mechanisms largely work as planned in missouri however we saw a seven million dollar negative impact the margins against normal weather consisting of two components first w n a r this new weather normalization tools introduced in our last rate proceeding and should ensure that we get the right recovery of the residential biometric charge not over collecting a coal period not under collecting and warmer ones while the mechanism did address a portion of our weather deficiencies this water we estimate that it was ineffective by six percent or roughly five million dollars secondly we saw a shortfall in commercial and industrial margins that do not have whether mitigation in missouri even for smaller more weather sensitive customers on pact here was about two million dollars we clearly have some work to do working with our regulators to improve the effectiveness of our weather mitigation our next missouri rate proceeding and to generating earnings from other sources in the back half of two thousand and twenty to offset some of this head when there were two other key variances this quarter on m expenses and other expenses of outline here in flight thirteen total o and m expenses as reported were down twelve sixty million dollars and although we have a history of cost control this reduction reflects the benefit of a regulatory deferral of a pension remeasure charge with the offsetting expense recorded and other expenses as shown here excluding this adjustment", "wer":

{"audio_filepath": "/home/ntadevosyan/data/earnings_align/./cut/4344866_part2.wav", "duration": 1200.65, "text": "this adjustment our run rate utility O&M was up $2.90 million or 2.60% due to higher operations and employee costs The remaining O&M expenses represent higher marketing costs due to our business growth and a cost of Spire STL pipeline which is now in operations The other key variances in other expenses with a run rate increase after the adjustment for the peasant pension re-measurement of $6.50 million reflecting two items First prior year Spire STL pipeline AFUDC which no longer exists is now inter-operating numbers And secondly a $3.60 million swing in returns on investments held the support on non-qualified benefit plans Not surprisingly this year we saw unrealized losses this quarter compared to a much stronger earning stream in the first quarter of 201 I would note that the explanation of all cost variances contribution margins as well as our review of our year-to-date results are included in the appendix to this presentation for your reference You know since the health crisis began we've been focused on our liquidity position hearkening back to our flight book from the great recession We moved aggressively with the assistance of our bank group to draw on our credit facility in mid-March as the commercial paper market became uneconomic In late March we secured $150 million term loan to provide additional liquidity And we stand in a strong financial position with total available liquidity at March 31 of $661 million and a solid long-term capitalization as well In fact we issued equity early in the quarter with proceeds of just under $10 million As we turn to the coronavirus impacts on our operating results a bit of perspective roughly 70% of our earnings and margins are residential And the current health crisis fit near the end of the winter heating season where we earn a majority of our return As a result we've been relatively insulated so far from the economic downturn We are watching closely our commercial and industrial customers especially the smaller firms who are bearing the brunt of the of the current shutdown And we are tracking the incremental costs that the actions that Steve and Suzanne touched on a few minutes ago Now none of us have a crystal ball to predict how this situation will play out Based on what we know today including data and regional economic projections we've constructed a forecast of key impacts based upon the following assumptions From an economic standpoint continuation of the downturn through this quarter and then a slow ramp up in activity that will stretch at least through the rest of calendar 2020 From an operational standpoint normal weather or return of normal collection activities disconnection and late payment fees as well as minimal disruption for our construction crews Based on these assumptions we have estimated the following financial impacts As a result of our moratorium on fees we anticipate losing fee revenue of roughly $1.90 million We have um seen some decline in our commercial and industrial margins reflecting both the temporary shutdowns of large manufacturers and the anticipated lower demand from our smart commercial accounts We estimate that impact to be approximately $2.20 million We have not yet seen any appreciable change in our residential margins and we will continue to monitor that closely However we are anticipating a significant increase in bad deaths in the coming quarters To estimate our exposure we went back to our records for the last recession in 2008 and 2009 when we saw bad debt expense as a percentage of revenue increase about 20 basis points over normal levels flying that experience to our current book of business results uh in an estimated exposure of three and a half million dollars And of course we're tracking other uh direct costs including the cost of PP&E enhanced facility cleaning employee costs for lost time among others We are pursuing opportunities to offset these headwinds including identifying those costs that would naturally be lower as a result of stay at home orders such as travel and we're finding additional operating efficiencies We're also working with our regulators as Steve mentioned both as we have been uh to deal with the immediate impacts to our customers and our business uh during the quarter and now discussing potential regulatory treatment of the increased costs including bad debts and the cost of responding to the health crisis and helping our customers recover Stepping back our estimates are based upon a current view of the economic recovery And as you can see we have provided sensitivities on each of these key exposures to gauge the impact under a different sets of assumptions Looking forward we remain on solid ground and are focused on growth As Steve mentioned we've upgraded our capital investment target for the year to $640 million In addition we've updated our five-year capital investment target now through 2024 to $2.80 billion That level of investment is driven by utility infrastructure upgrades and should drive rate-based growth of between 7% and 8% for the forecast period In addition we reaffirm our long-term net economics per share growth target of 4% to 7% And given the current uncertainty surrounding the resolution of our Missouri disrupts recovery we'll continue to refrain from BPS guidance for fiscal year 2020 at this time And finally our financing plans remain on track with only modest equity needs for the remainder of 202 So in summary we're in solid shape and remain focused on delivering for all of our stakeholders With that let me turn it back over to you Suzanne Thank you Steve and Steve as we close today's presentation I think it's important to take a moment to acknowledge the strength of our collective energy Buyers utilities have been operating for more than 160 years thanks to great leadership great partnerships and a legacy of hardworking caring employees We have survived Wars the great depression weather disasters and the 1918 influenza pandemic The law of successful history and with the support of our investors our communities and our public policy leaders we will work our way through the impact of the coronavirus We'll do it together and we'll do it in a way that brings sustained long-term value for our shareholders customers and the communities we serve Before we open for questions I'd like to thank Spire's employees many whom are listening to this webcast I know how hard you work and I know how much you care about one another our customers and the communities that we live and work in You make me proud every day and I'm forever grateful for the way you rally to answer challenges You are leaders you are conveners you are helpers you are heroes You understand that fundamentally energy exists to help people and you give your all to deliver energy safely reliably and with all your heart To the investors and analysts on the call today we'd like to thank you for your investment and the trust you place in us On behalf of our board of directors our executive team and our employees we take that trust very seriously especially during these uncertain times We look forward to seeing you again soon either as part of the upcoming virtual AGA financial forum or other virtual conferences and road shows in the months ahead Of course we look forward to the time when we can once again meet face-to-face Until then we wish you well and trust that you will stay safe and healthy Now we'll take your questions We will now begin the question and answer session To ask a question you may press star then one on your telephone keypad If you are using a speakerphone please pick up your handset before pressing the keys To withdraw your question please press star then two At this time we will pause momentarily to assemble our roster The first question comes from Richie Ci- Ciciarelli with BofA Securities Please go ahead Hey good morning Uh hope everyone's healthy and safe today Appreciate you taking my questions Um just had a couple here on ISRS Um can you just go over the the difference between the two versions of the the house and Senate bill and and where you ultimately expect that that to land uh once it gets reconciled And then on the um recent settlement um with the ISRS filing where I guess what changed this time around with the OPC where you were able to garner a se- a settlement there Hi Richie This is Steve Lindsey um and I appreciate you calling in this morning Uh on your first question relative to the legislation in in terms of the content of our portion there's really not that much different between the house and Senate bills What you have are some some things that that get attached uh as as they go through the process And so really uh we're fairly consistent with those bills And again if you go back to what they're trying to accomplish uh it's to really reinforce what the intent of the statute was when it was put in place over 15 years ago which is uh around infrastructure upgrades particularly around bare steel and cast iron Uh and and to really just kind of caught it by some of that in terms of the language So I don't think there's a lot of difference between those two And that's why when it goes back to the committee for reconciliation uh there'll be some cleanup relative to the things that are attached there Uh relative to your your second part of the question in terms of the stipulation I think we've just been working collectively uh and and again we we felt this way all along that that the pipe that we've been replacing uh meets all the requirements relative to what needs to be part of the infrastructure upgrades included in the ISRS program Uh even to the fact that we still agree that that the plastics that we've been replacing are much more efficient way to upgrade our system Uh but this primarily focused on the bare steel and cast iron And did they meet those criteria We're providing additional evidence but I think uh in terms of the reason that we got to this is because we continued to work together to to strongly support again the intent of of why we've been replacing this pipe around safety reliability and efficiency of operating our systems So I think it's I think it's progress if you want to look at it that way And again even with the cases that are still there uh we'll continue to present evidence uh and hopefully make our case around the pipe that had been replaced in previous years uh is the same criteria that we're using going forward Got it Thank you That's that's very helpful Um and then just around your your CapEx profile um I think you might've been been one of the few companies that raised their spending this year for 202 Um just curious what's given you the increased competence to ex- execute on on the plan this year um given the the headwinds with with COVID-related pressures Hey Richie this is Steve Great question Um a couple of things first of all I guess the downside uh the warmer weather that has impacted our margins is it does give us uh a little bit better uh working conditions on our capital spend And as as Steve talked about we had a strong uh winter season and now we're heading into the the heart of our capital spend So I think that's point number one And then number two you know uh playbook for utilities as we look at how we can best um try to offset both uh the headwinds from weather and also the headwinds from coronavirus that we talked about um ramping up our capital spend is one of those activities It's clearly something that helps get us back to work uh and we're doing it with the cooperation and understanding of all the leaders throughout our states and our jurisdictions And I think it's just helping us to ensure that not only are we doing the right thing by upgrading our infrastructure but we're also doing it in a way that's gonna make us more resilient as we go forward So I think that it's really just an evolution of all those things And again you've seen us ramp up and and ramp down in the past and we think this is an opportunity for us to ramp up a little bit And and Richie this is um the other Steve let me follow up from an operational perspective I would like to reinforce that as we and again while this past quarter was only really several weeks uh in terms of the measurement period uh we never stopped working Uh and and you'll hear some businesses talk about return to work Uh we talked about more of the transition and if you think about it from a construction and capital perspective uh we we really didn't take our foot off the gas We obviously changed some of our processes and procedures relative to personal protective equipment And and to be quite honest we limited going into customer's homes to do uh service uh tie overs and change overs We'll go back and do that But but again in terms of the infrastructure that we've been working on and will continue to that really didn't slow down And that's a great tribute to our our our frontline and boys the management that's out there that that really put you know pulled together If you think about our three strategic areas of focus one of those is innovation and we got innovative in the way we're continuing to think about our work The other part I would just wanna reinforce is that uh our capital for these type programs is fairly evenly distributed across our three major operating areas in terms of the side of Missouri West and Alabama Uh and so we're not just impacted in one area in terms of and upper back we're fa- fairly evenly spread even with the new business as well So if you think about that uh increase that we saw a year-to-date of of nearly 10% that are referenced that's pretty evenly spread across all of our operating companies which I think gives us uh a good balance as well Yeah thank you very much I appreciate it All right That's all I had Thanks The next question comes from Michael Weinstein with Credit Suisse please go ahead Hi good morning Hi Hi Hey I was wondering if you guys have a better sense at all uh how whether legislation would preclude uh the need for a ruling at the Supreme Court or not You know at this point you know after conferring with your own lawyers and maybe outside counsel Um Michael this is Steve The the the Supreme Court opportunity at least for that um the ruling that came out of the appellate court um has already passed They they um opted not to take the um- Oh I get it the appeal that we end the Public Service Commission went forward So really the the legislation um that Steve Lindsey talks about is the best opportunity for a longer term fix We obviously are continuing to work with uh Missouri Public Service Commission the staff the OPC and the other interveners to um not only Crispin up the um the support for our filings uh but then also to get to a more unified view going forward of what makes sense for our customers And I I would just say too that's consistent with when we started this journey we pursued a regulatory legislative and judicial outcome And so all three of those paths So uh we're on track with what we strategically set out to begin with Uh what's the July 16th decision that we're waiting on What is that Okay So uh so this would be a d- this is on the cases that were remanded back to the commission So once they go back to the Public Service Commission uh they in essence have 120 days to make a decision based on those cases that that did not go through to the Supreme Court So so you've got several moving parts that are going on here from the legislative perspective and regulatory but but that is on the cases that were under appeal that have been remanded back to the commission Oh those dec- the decision you're referencing there is the decision by the regulators right On the right Yeah Uh this is it's been remanded back to the Missouri Commission yes Got it I got it Okay And on the guidance the long-term guidance the base year is still 2019 Or is there a base year Yeah You know I I I chuckle Michael It's a fair question I I think the answer is if you look at our capital spend program over five years and driving rate-based growth of 7% to 8% we expect that we should be able to drive the kind of growth that we've talked about in the longterm over the bottom line I chuckle because we're all dealing with and we've spent a lot of time and I know our peers are because you've been on those calls a lot of time dealing with the current situation Yeah And the fullness of time as we understand what's happening in in in the current year 2020 we'll find a way to rebase and make sure everybody understands But right now we're just trying to make sure that we and our customers get through this year And we do it in a fashion that we feel good about so that when we hit 2021 and beyond we're hitting it at full steam with our customers coming along for the ride Yeah That would be my understanding I mean I think a lot of people are trying to look through 2020 as a abnormal year so that's just wanted to see what It's definitely to be an abnormal year Yeah Yeah I think a lot of people would like to look through this year Um all right Thank you very much guys and stay safe and healthy Thanks Again if you have any questions please press star then one The next question comes from Brian with Please go ahead Hi Good morning Good morning Brian Good morning Brian Hey just curious on the um weather normalization uh mechanism in Missouri uh that was um you know ineffective what you know structurally what made it ineffective and what would you need to do it in in in so far as uh you know further discussions with uh regulators and/or uh uh you during your next rate case uh to fix it Or can it be perfect All right Well good morning This is Steve Lindsey Thanks for the question And uh I wish I knew all the answers to that because it's a very complex formula Uh I think the one thing I would say is is we have something in place now that we didn't have before which is positive Uh it did help but it didn't completely address the the the differences between uh weather obviously and and and the volumes and the revenue So but I think there's a couple pieces to it One is and I think that Steve mentioned this uh first of all it does not even include uh the small commercial class and some of those others that are really weather sensitive and look and behave a lot like the residential class So I think that's one opportunity that if you look at other weather normalization mechanisms in the country they do include that So so that's clearly an opportunity The other is that it's it's not linear And and what I mean by that is every day isn't the same every week isn't the same as you go through the month So you could have some outcomes that show results days that didn't really translate to the way gas load from a customer's perspective So I think there's opportunity as we move forward And and again it's a it's a start uh it's not perfect We recognize that And we think we'll be able uh to make a pretty strong presentation as to where the deficiencies are Because again the program is intended to mitigate risk Uh as as Steve indicated uh if it's too cold we shouldn't benefit If it's too warm we shouldn't be harmed And it's really to try to tighten that band And and what we would look to do going forward is to tighten the band even closer than than what it is now Got it And and re- remind me what percent of the overall bill is a fixed charge Yeah", "pred_text": "our run rate utility on was up two point nine million dollars or two six percent due to higher operations and employee cost remaining on m expenses represent higher marketing costs due to our business growth and the cost of the spiral pipeline which is now in operations the other key variance is in other expenses with a run rate increase after the adjustment for the present pension remediate of six million five hundred thousand dollars reflecting two items first prior years fire s t l pipeline a u d c which no longer exists and now in our operating numbers and secondly three point six million dollars wing and returns on investments held to support our non qualified benefit plans not surprisingly this year we saw unrealized losses this quarter compared to a much stronger earning stream in the first quarter of two thousand and nineteen i would note that the explanation of all cost variances contribution margins as well as our review of our year to date results are included in the appendix to this presentation for your reference you know since the health crisis began we've been focused on our liquidity position harkening back to our playbook from the great recession we moved aggressively with the assistance of our bank group to draw on our credit facility in mid march as the commercial paper market became uneconomic in late march we secured one hundred and fifty million dollars term loan to provide additional liquidity and we stand in a strong financial position with total available liquidity at march thirty one of six hundred and sixty one million dollars and a solid long term capitalization as well in fact we issued equity early in the quarter with proceeds of just under ten million dollars as we turn to the coronavirus impacts on our operating results a bit of perspective roughly seventy percent of our earnings and margins are residential and the current health crisis near the end of the winter heating season where we earn a majority of our return as a result we've been relatively insulated so far from the economic downturn we are watching closely our commercial and industrial customers especially the smaller firms who are bearing the brunt of the current shutdown and we are tracking the incremental cost of the actions that stevens is and touched on a few minutes ago now none of us have a crystal ball to predict how the situation will play out based on what we know today including data and regional economic projections we've constructed a forecast of key impacts based upon the following assumptions from an economic standpoint continuation of the downturn through this quarter and then a slow wrap up in activity that will stretch at least through the rest of calendar two thousand and twenty from an operational standpoint normal weather a return of normal collection activities disconnection and late payment fees as well as minimal disruption for our construction crews based on these assumptions we have estimated the following financial impacts as a result of our moratorium on fees we anticipate losing the revenue of roughly one million nine hundred thousand dollars we have seen some decline in our commercial and industrial margins reflecting both the temporary shutdowns of large manufacturers and the anticipated lower demand from our commercial accounts yes to make that impact to be approximately two hundred thousand dollars we have not yet seen any appreciable change in our residential margins and we will continue to monitor that closely however we are anticipating a significant increase in bad debts in the coming quarters to estimate our exposure we went back to our records for the last recession in two thousand and eight and two thousand and nine when we saw bad expense as a percentage of revenue increase about twenty basis points over normal levels lying that experience her current book of business results in an estimated exposure of three and a half one million dollars and of course we're tracking other direct cost including the cost of p p and hans facility cleaning employee cost for lost time among others we are pursuing opportunities to offset these headwinds including identifying those costs that would naturally be lower as a result of stay at home orders such as travel and we're finding additional operating efficiencies we're also working with our regulators as steve mentioned as we have been deal with the immediate impact to our customers in our business during the water and now discussing potential regulatory treatment of the increased cost including bad that and the cost of responding to the health crisis and helping our customers recover stepping back our estimates are based upon a current view of the economic recovery and as you can see we have provided sensitivities on each of these key exposures to gauge the impact under a different set of assumptions looking forward we remain on solid ground and are focused on growth as steve mentioned we've upgraded our capital investment target for the year to six hundred and forty million dollars in addition we've updated our five year capital investment target now through two thousand and twenty four to two eighty million dollars that level of investment is driven by utility infrastructure upgrades and should drive rate based growth of between seventy eight percent for the forecast period in addition reaffirm our long term net economics per share growth target of four percent to seven percent and given the current uncertainty surrounding the resolution of our missouri dish recovery will continue to refrain from e p s guidance for fiscal year two thousand and twenty at this time and finally our financing plans remain on track with only modest equity needs for the remainder of two thousand and twenty so in summary we're in solid shape and remain focused on delivering for all of our stakeholders but that let me turn back over to you suzanne thank you and because today presentation i think it's important to take a moment to acknowledge the strength of our collective energy fires utilities have been operating for more than one hundred sixty years thanks to great leadership partnership and a legacy of hardworking caring employees we have survived wars the great depression weather disasters and the one thousand and eighteen influenza pandemic the law of successful history and with the support of our investors our communities and our public policy leaders we will work our way through the impact of the coronavirus together do it in a way that brings the same long term value for our shareholders customers and the communities we serve or we open for questions i like to think fires employees many whom are listening to this webcast i know how hard you work and i know how much you care about one another our customers and the communities that we live and work in many proud every day and i am forever grateful for the way you rally to answer challenges you are leaders your conveners you are helpers you are heroes you understand that fundamentally energy exists to help people and you give your all to deliver energy safely reliably with all your heart is an analyst on the call today we like to thank you for your

can once again face to face until then we wish you well and trust that you will stay safe and healthy now we'll take your question we will now begin the question and answer session to ask a question you may press star than one on your telephone keypad if you are using a speakerphone please pick up your handset before pressing the key to withdraw your question please press star then too at this time we will pause momentarily to assemble our roster the first question comes from richie says sister rally with b of a security please go ahead good morning everyone healthy and safe today appreciate taking my questions just had a couple here on is wrist can you just go over the difference between the two versions of the house and senate bill and where you ultimately expect that that to land once it gets reconciled and then on the recent settlement what the interest filing where i guess what changes time around with o b c where you are able to garner self a settlement ridges the steve linda and i appreciate you calling in this morning on your first question relative to the legislation in terms of the content of our portion there's really not that much difference between the house and senate bills what you have or some things that get attached as they go through the process and so really we're fairly consistent with those bills and again if you go back to what they're

and hopefully make our case around the pipe that had been replaced in previous years is the same criteria that we're using going forward god i thank you that's very helpful and then just around your catholics profile i think you might have been one of the few companies a raider spending this year from two thousand and twenty just curious what's given you the increased confidence x execute on the plan this year given the headwinds with cove it related pressures richie this is steve great question couple things first of all i guess the downside the warmer weather that has impacted our margins is it does give us a little bit better working conditions on our capital spend and as he talked about we had a strong winter season and now we're heading into the heart of our capital span so i think that point number one and the number two playbook for utilities as we look at how we can best try to offset both the headlines from weather and also the headwinds from growth of ours that we talk

increase that we saw here to date of nearly ten percent that i referenced that's pretty evenly spread across all of our operating companies which i think gives us a good balance as well thank you very much appreciate it that's all i had the next question comes from michael weinstein with credit suisse please go ahead good morning i was wondering if you guys have a better sense at all how whether legislation would preclude the need for a ruling at the supreme court or not you know at this point after conferring with your own lawyers and maybe outside counsel michael supreme court opportunity at least for the rulings that came out of the appellate court has already passed they they opted not to take get the appeal that we and the public service mission but for so really the legislation that steve lency talk about is the best opportunity for a longer term fix we obviously are continuing to work with missouri public service commission the staff the o p c and the other intervenors to not only chris but the support for filings but also to get to a more unified view going forward of what makes sense for a customer and i would say to that system with started this journey we pursued a regulatory legislative and judicial outcome and all three of those paths so we're on track with what we strategically set out to begin with what's the july sixteenth decision that we're waiting on ok so this would be this is on the cases that were remanded back to the commission so once they go back to the boat service commission they in essence have one hundred and twenty days to make a decision based on those cases that did not go through to the supreme court so you got several moving parts that are going on here from a legislative perspective and regulatory but but that is on the cases that were under appeal that have been remanded back to the commission although the decision you're referencing there is a decision by the regulators on the remedy commission yes got it i got it ok and on the guidance the long term guidance the base here is still two thousand and nineteen different question i think the answer is if you look at our capital spend program over five years driving rate based growth to seventy percent we expect that we should be able to drive the kind of road that we talk about a long term over the bottom line i chuckle because we're all dealing with and we've spent a lot of time and i know our peers are because you've been on those calls a lot of time dealing with the current situation and and the fullness of time as we understand what's happening and the

in a fashion that we feel good about so that we had two thousand and twenty want to be on we're hitting at it full steam with our customers coming along yeah that would be my understanding i mean i think a lot of people are trying to look through two thousand and twenty as a normal year so that's just want to see what has been i think a lot of people would like to look through this year thank you very much guys and stay safe and healthy again if you have any questions please press star then one the next question comes from brian russo with the daddy please go ahead good morning just curious on the weather normalization mechanism in missouri that was quote unquote ineffective what you know structurally what made it ineffective and what would you need to do insofar as you know further discussions with regulators and or you know during your next rake case to fix it or can it ever be perfect all right well good morning this is the lindsey thanks for the question and i wish i knew all the answers to that because it's a very complex formula i think the one thing i would say is we have something in place now we didn't have before which is positive it did help but it didn't completely address the differences between whether obviously and the volumes in the revenues but i think there's a couple pieces do it one is and i think even mention it first of all it does not even

of our employees Moving to slide five I would like to grind everyone on the critical priorities we're following during these challenging times When we closed the transaction a little over two months ago we could have never anticipated that within a matter of weeks we would be dealing with a global pandemic causing disruption to our customers supply chain and the day-to-day operations of the company Our response speaks to how the IRX toolkit has effectively helped us plan accelerate and adapt our actions to act quickly and decisively around three core priorities First ensuring the safety of our employees customers and the community Second around keeping a strong focus on the integration and execution to ensure the financial stability of the company through these uncertain time And finally continuing to execute on the strategy of the company as we have multiple capitalists to drive ongoing body creation The strength of Ingersoll Rand team align around these three priorities We'll position the company to emerge from this crisis as a stronger and more unified company The next slide is a reminder that our purpose and values as well as our execution engine that we call IRX are really at the heart of how we operate as a company especially in these unprecedented times During the integration process we spent a lot of time thoughtfully creating the company's purpose One that is centered around our stakeholders where we know that they can lean on us to help make life better This purpose when combined with the four key values that our teams live on a daily basis creates a framework of what we want to achieve as a company And the basis of how we do it is the Ingersoll Rand execution excellence process The simplicity and effectiveness of this is allowing us to accelerate the creation of a single culture across Ingersoll Rand to slide seven I would like to briefly update you on the company's response to the COVID-19 crisis since it has been swift and focused around two major components First is a health and safety and wellbeing of our employees customers our communities And second business continuity not only within operations but across a larger supply chain Starting first with health and safety we activated our COVID-19 passports in February and had a full coordinated company approach in early March just weeks after the creation of the new company Our execution approach has served us very well as we're able to quickly implement enhanced site safety protocols and a mandatory work from home policy for those employees who can work remotely And it is very encouraging that our quick actions have been successful As we currently have had fewer than 30 confirmed cases of COVID-19 amongst our more than 17,000 global employee base For is more than just implementing safety protocols It's also about supporting and engaging the employee base As a result we have implemented a number of measures including a global outreach program to employee feedback Employees reacted quickly and with a true ownership mindset provided more than 200 suggestions when we asked for cost savings ideas Not only did our team volunteer to take individual pay cuts furloughs and forgo vacation time this year they have thoughtful in-depth suggestions Many of which we're actively implementing today From a business continuity perspective Starting first with our operations as we previously communicated we have seen plans largely in China Italy and India impacted due to COVID-19 China was largely impacted in the month of January and February and has seen steadily improved capacity and output through March and into April As things are now largely back to normal Italy and India saw about two month lag to China with operations being impacted in late March and into April And in these time our sites around the globe are 98% operational with India still being the most impacted due to governmental restrictions on returning to work The supply chain has seen a similar trend as the impact in China is largely behind us and we currently have no meaningful deliveries issues The Americas and regions are stabilizing As impacted suppliers in the U.S. and Italy have started to come back online In the past few weeks we have seen the number of impact of suppliers drop by more than half which is a very good sign and we're supplementing supply from dual sources from other regions where possible Much like our operations India continues to be the most impacted aspect of the supply chain And we expect the situation to improve in the later half of May when governmental restrictions begin to ease We are addressing the current environment head on by actively managing those areas within our control So let me tell you about what we're doing here Starting with slide eight through the use of IRX we have been able to build the cost synergy funnel to over $350 million with increases across all major savings categories And we continue to identify areas of incremental opportunity As a reminder we expect to be able to realize the anticipated transaction cost synergies of approximately $250 million by the end of year three after closing We expect to incur approximately $450 million of expense in connection with both achieving these cost synergies and the associated stand up of the new company As we have stated multiple times over the past few quarters the facing of synergy delivery was always an area we believe we could accelerate based on market conditions And that is exactly what we have done We have dramatically increased the pace having already executed on $90 million of annualized structural cost reductions with approximately $17 million savings expected to be delivered in 2020 The majority of this savings are coming from headcount actions already taken in the past two months as we streamline the company and reduce the years within the organization In addition we have deployed the first wave of procurement initiative with RFQs for nearly one-third of our historical direct materials span base already launched as well as some quick win initiatives being deployed In total we're now expecting to deliver approximately 35% of our overall synergy target in 2020 which is approximately three times higher than the original year one expectation of 10 to 15% realization We're keeping the overall cost synergy target at $250 million over a three year timeframe at this time to remain prudent on volume dependent synergies like procurement and I to be given the current environment It is not only the structural costs that we have taken out but also how we are supplementing our synergy delivery activities with thoughtful short-term cost reductions to protect margins So let's move to slide nine to talk about that In Q1 despite the 15% revenue decline that we saw collectively across the business on a pro forma basis we were able to limit adjusted EBITDA incrementals to less than 30% With the strongest performance coming from our two largest segments We expect that these additional actions would yield 40 to $50 million of incremental cost savings in the P&L this year with the majority coming in the second quarter and third quarter We will continue to reevaluate on a monthly basis and if the main environment does not accelerate in the second half of the year we will potentially extend some of these actions and increase our savings target accordingly While we're making some top decisions to control costs One area that we're not cutting back is strategic growth initiatives across the enterprise Much like we did back in 2015 at Gardner Denver when we invested through the downturn to capitalize on market share gains and new broad opportunities We're following the same playbook today Investments in R&D are being maintained at similar levels as prior years And we continue to fund target the commercial initiatives such as demand generation and now IOT platforms This is all part of a strategy to play offense Now especially as we bring the two companies together through the integration Moving to slide 10 Let me talk about liquidity The company continues to have a strong balance sheet with ample liquidity At the time of the merger we took the opportunity to reprice our legacy debt for placing the new $1.9 billion firm loan to close the transaction All of our debt is a term loan based structure with very attractive pricing as the components are 175 and the Euro component is plus 200 So some loans have no financial covenants from a maintenance perspective and there are no maturities until 2027 Liquidity also remains strong at $1.6 billion as we finished the quarter with $556 million of cash on the balance sheet and over a billion dollars of capacity on our existing credit facilities As we look ahead we continue to see several opportunities to the cash As we remained very prudent on preserving liquidity Opportunities exists across working capital and cash taxes And we will continue to see tailwinds from entrance expense in the second half of the year as all $825 million of legacy fixed interest rate swaps will expire by September of 2020 Even though we feel our level of liquidity is proper we're evaluating incremental debt or other liquidity vehicles given the attractive rate and covenant environment Turning to slide 11 Our commitment to our long-term strategy remains unwavering You have heard me already reference several elements of our strategy As we're building the culture of Ingersoll Rand with our employees at the core We will continue to act quickly and prudently to protect margins and preserve liquidity And at the same time we will position the company for future growth both organically and through opportunistic targeted bolt-on M&A Our business operates in a very fragmented markets and we see opportunities to add niche technologies to the portfolio And importantly our newest strategic priority of operating sustainably is taking shape as we launch several of our ESG orienter initiatives already Overall we have several value creation levers as we look ahead and we will continue to execute despite the uncertain micro economic landscape I will now turn it over to Emily to walk you through the financials Emily Thanks Vicente On slide 12 you will see the as reported financials for the company As a reminder the reported financials include three months of legacy Gardner Denver and one month of the legacy Ingersoll Rand Industrial Segment in Q1 2020 and only the legacy Gardner Denver businesses in Q1 of 2019 As a result the comparisons are impacted materially by the transaction I won't spend a lot of time on this page as a result other than to mention that the as reported net income in the quarter includes $197 million of amortization acquisition restructuring and other adjustments which you can see listed in the reconciliation tables in the appendix of the presentation Turning to slide 13 To assist in clean comparatives for the quarter we provided supplemental financial information which treats the transaction as if it had happened as of January one 2018 From a total company perspective FX adjusted revenue in orders declined 14% and 7% respectively and were impacted by COVID-19 Regionally we saw notable declines in Asia Pacific as well as sharp declines in the US and Europe towards the end of the quarter Most notably in the ITNS segment This led both to bill to finish at 1.11 for the quarter The company delivered 208 million of adjusted EBITDA a decline of 24% driven mostly by the volume declines in ITNS and the expected downturn in the HPS segment Adjusted EBITDA margins were 16.4% down 200 basis points from last year However our proactive cost controls within the business limited detrimental to 29% In terms of adjusted EBITDA composition for the company the legacy Gardner Denver business delivered 97 million as compared to our original guidance expectation of approximately a hundred million which we view as relatively strong performance given the environment The legacy IR businesses delivered 51 million of adjusted EBITDA in March as opposed to a combined 60 million for January and February Moving to slide 14 The cash flow for the quarter was $60 million on an as reported basis including $8 million of CapEx The Q1 free cash flow includes $63 million of outflows related to the transaction Comprised of 38 million of synergy delivery and stand up related costs And another 25 million of transaction fees We also paid $38 million of debt issuance costs in the quarter which you can see in the financing section of the cash flow statement Bringing our total transaction related outflows in the quarter to a hundred million dollars From a leverage perspective we finished at 2.6 times And while we do expect to see some short-term increase to leverage we have shown the ability to deliver historically As you can see on the right side of the page we'll remain extremely disciplined on cash and we expect our capital allocation priorities to be very aligned with what you have seen historically Specifically internal reinvestments for growth prudent debt pay down and opportunistic bolt-on M&A We have no plans for any share repurchases or a dividend at this time I'll now turn it back to Vicente to walk through the segments Vicente Thanks Emily Starting first with industrial technologies and services in slide 15 The ITNS segment first quarter adjusted order intake was $889 million down 9% versus prior year excluding effects Adjusted revenues in the quarter were $796 million down 17% excluding effects and leading to a book to bill ratio of 1.12 times From a regional perspective Asia-Pacific revenues were down in the mid thirties With Europe down 15% and Americans down 7% all excluding effects We use these trend in as an indication of how Q2 could potentially play out meaning that the APEC decline in Q1 is what we expect to see in Americas in the near term This is the baseline we're using to plan the cost controls for our business But we're staying highly active with demand generation activities and pricing controls while we continue to demonstrate discipline in price generating over 1% in the quarter For these markets are more opaque than historically We're using our unique data acquisition strategy to map order trends and remain agile in serving our customers in the current environment We break these out into two areas aftermarket and original equipment For aftermarket a leading indicator we have is actual compressor utilization data As we can see the hourly usage of thousands of compressors worldwide that are connected to our remote monitoring system In America than Europe we saw a sharp decline in compressor utilization in the last few weeks of March of nearly 30% with some recovery in the past few weeks of April We're now using these as a way to know where our service teams need to focus while at the same time using", "pred_text": "thank you for standing by and welcome to the ingersoll rand first quarter two thousand and twenty earnings conference call at this time all participants are in a listen

plans largely in china italy and india impacted due to cover nineteen china was largely impacted in the months of january february and has seen steadily improved capacity and output through march and

is largely behind us and we currently have no meaningful delivery issues america and regions are stabilizing as impacted suppliers in the u s and italy have started to come back online in the past two

asians india continues to be the most impacted aspect of the supply chain and we expect the situation to improve in the later half of maine when governmental restrictions begin to ease we are addressing the current environment head on by actively managing those areas within our control let me tell you about what we're doing here starting with side eight through the use of irrex we have been able to build the cost energy funnel to over three hundred fifty million dollars with increases across all major saving categories and we continue to identify areas of incremental opportunity as a reminder we expect to be able to realize the empty bit of transaction customer jersey two hundred fifty million dollars by the end of year three after closing we expect to incur approximately four hundred fifty million dollars of expense in connection with both achieving these cost energy and the associated stand up of the new company as we have stated multiple times over the past quarters the facing of synergy delivery was always an area we believe we could accelerate based on market conditions and that is exactly what we have done we have dramatically increased the pace having already executed on ninety million dollars of annualized structural cost reductions with approximately seventy million dollars savings expected to be deliver in twenty twenty the majority of the savings are coming from headcount actions already taken in the past two months as we streamlined the company and reduce layers within the organization in addition we have deployed the first wave of procurement initiative with our cues for nearly one third of our historical direct materials pan base already launched as well as some quick wind initiatives being deployed in total we're now expecting to deliver approximately thirty five percent of our overall synergy target in two thousand and twenty which is approximately three times higher than the original year one expectation of ten to fifteen percent reallocation we're keeping the overall cost energy target at two hundred and fifty million dollars over a three year timeframe at this time to remain prudent on all independent synergies like procurement and i have to be given the current environment it is not only the structural cost that we have taken out but also how we are supplementing our synergy to labor activities with thoughtful short term cost reductions to protect margins let's move to line nine to talk about that if you want despite the fifteen percent ready decline that we saw collectively across the business on a pro forma basis we were able to limit adjusted even though the common folks to less than thirty percent with the strongest performance coming from our two largest segments with think that these additional actions would yield forty to fifty million dollars of incremental cost savings in the p m of this year with a majority coming in the second quarter and third quarter we will continue to reevaluate on a monthly basis and if the man environment does not accelerate in the second half of the year we will potentially extend some of these actions and increase our savings are going to cordon but we're making some tough decisions to control cost one area that we're not going back is strategic growth initiatives across the enterprise much like we did back in two thousand and fifteen i garden denver when we invested through the bouncer to capitalize on market share gains and new product opportunities following the same play but today investments in r and d are being maintained at similar levels of prior years and we continue to fund targeted commercial initiatives such as imagine a ship and our i o p platforms this is all part of a strategy to play often now especially as we bring the two companies together through the integration going to fly pen let me talk about liquidity the company continues to have a strong balance sheet with ample liquidity at the time of the merger we took the opportunity to reprise our legacy that placing the new one point nine billion dollars term loan to close the transaction all of our debt is a term loan be structure with very attractive pricing as a u s components are libel one seventy five and that your component is a eurobo or plus two hundred thermontes have no financial covenants from a man's perspective and there are no maturities until twenty twenty seven equity also remains strong at one point six billion dollars as we finish a quarter with five hundred fifty six million dollars of cash on the bounds and over a billion dollars of capacity on our existing credit facilities as we look ahead we continue to see several opportunities to on the cash as we remain very prudent on preserving equity opportunities exist across working capital and cash taxes and we will continue to see tell wins from interest expense in the second half of the year as all eight hundred twenty five million dollars of legacy fixed interest rate swaps will expire by september of two thousand and twenty even though we feel our level of the quiddity is proper or evaluate incremental debt or other quickly vehicles given the attractive rate and covenant environment to flight eleven our commitment to our long term strategy remains unwavering you have heard me already referenced several elements of our strategy as we're building the culture of ingest over and with our employees at the core we will continue to act quickly and prudently to protect margins and preserve liquidity and at the same time we will position the company for future growth both organically and through opportunistic targeted bolt on m and our business operates in a very fragment of markets and we see opportunities to add niche technologies to the portfolio and importantly our newest strategic priority of operating sustainably is taking shape as we launched several of our intent initiatives already overall we have several valley creation levers as we look ahead and we will continue to execute the uncertain microeconomic landscape i will now turn it over to emily to walk you through the financials i mean thanks the same day twelve you will see the as reported financial for the company as a reminder the reported financials include three months of legacy gardner denver and one month of the legacy in their salt rand industrial segment in two thousand and twenty and only the legacy garner denver business in q one of two thousand and nineteen as a result the comparisons are impacted maturely by the transaction and work than a lot of time on this page as a result other than to mention that the as reported net income in the quarter includes one hundred and ninety seven million dollars of amortization acquisition restructuring and other adjustments which you can see listed in the reconciliation tables in the appendix of the presentation turning to slide thirteen to assisting clean comparative for the quarter we provided supplemental financial information which treats the transaction as if it happened as a general one two thousand and eighteen from a total company perspective effects adjusted revenue and orders declined fourteen percent and seven percent respectively and were impacted by cobb in nineteen regionally we thought notable declines in asia pacific as well as sharp declines in the u s and europe toward the end of the quarter most notably in the i p n s segment this led book to bill to finish at one point one one for the quarter the company delivered two hundred and eight million of adjusted even a decline of twenty four percent driven mostly by the volume declines in i p n s and the expected downturn in the h p s segment adjusted even that margins were sixteen four percent down two hundred basis points from last year however are proactive cost controls within the business limited decremental to twenty nine percent in terms of adjusted even composition for the company the legacy gardner denver business delivered ninety seven million as compared to our original guidance expectation of approximately one hundred million which we view as relatively strong performance given the environment the legacy i r businesses delivered fifty one million of a time march as opposed to a combined sixty million for january and february moving the fly fourteen free cash flow for the quarter with sixty million dollars on an as reported basis including eight million dollars of capback the q one free cash flow includes sixty three million dollars of outflows related to the transaction comprised of thirty eight million of energy delivery and stand up related cost and another twenty five million transaction fees we also paid thirty eight million dollars of debt issuance costs in the corner which you can see in the financing section of the cash flow statement bring our total transaction related outflows in the quarter to one hundred million dollars from a leverage perspective we finished at two six times and while we do expect to see some short term increase to leverage we have shown the ability to de lever historically as you can see on the right side of the page will remain extremely disciplined on cash and we expect our capital allocation priorities to be very aligned with what you have seen historically specifically internal reinvestments for growth prudent debt pay down and opportunistic full time and then we have no plans for any share repurchases or a dividend at this time and now turn it back to the center to walk through the segment thanks similarly starting first with industrial technologies and services like fifteen the i p n and segment first quarter adjusted order intake was eight hundred eighty nine million dollars down one percent versus prior year in the quarter were seven hundred ninety six million dollars down seventeen percent excluding effects and leading to a book to bill ratio of one point one two times from a regional perspective asia pacific revenues were down in the mid thirties with europe down fifteen percent and america down seven percent all excluding effects we use the trending as an indication of how you tube could potentially play out meaning that the apex declining q one is what we expect to see in america in the media in the near term this is a base on we're using to plan the cost controls for our business but we're staying highly active with imagination activities and present controls but we continue to demonstrate discipline in price generating over one percent in the quarter well these markets are more opaque than historically we're using our unique data acquisition strategy to mob order trends and remain agile in serving our customers in the current environment we break this out into two areas after market and original equipment for after market and leading indicator we have actual compressor utilization data as we can see the i want to use it of thousands of compressors worldwide that are connected to our remote monitoring system in america and europe we saw a sharp decline in compressive deletion in the last few weeks of march of nearly thirty percent with some recovery in the past few weeks of april we're

compressor business today For original equipment we're using demand generation leads We said in the past that demand gen was the leading indicator of orders that we're will be getting in the next six to eight weeks With more than a thousand leads per week We have a load of commercial insight in our system What we saw in the later weeks of March was a drop of 30% versus what we saw earlier in the quarter With similar trends in America and Europe We have seen also early signs of improvement over the past few weeks of April But still approximately 20 to 25% off from the highs in the early part of a year Let me give you now some color from a product line perspective We have seen very similar trends across compressors blowers and vacuums where we saw orders down in the mid to high single digits We have spoken about third-party industry reports in the past And the Q1 data speaks well for the outcome of the combining of the two companies According to a leading third party report the market in the US was down mid single digits in dollars in the first quarter Gardner Denver were flat and Ingersoll Rand was down high single digits But when you look into the details you see the power of the two companies As Gardner Denver saw good share gains on low to medium horsepower machines while Ingersoll Rand took share on high horsepower compressors This was exactly our hypothesis coming into the deal And we see these as a way to leverage the technology portfolio as well as the direct and indirect channels that both companies have Power tools and lift which is part of the segment had a very tough quarter with orders and revenue down both over 20% The business was highly impacted by large inventory purchases that online retailers typically make in the first quarter to support first half of the year revenue However this quarter in addition to the slowdown of the market many online retailers switch their focus to household essentials Moving to non- GAAP adjusted EBITDA ITNS deliver $135 million in the quarter which was down 25% Non- GAAP adjusted EBITDA margin was 17% which was down 150 versus points from the prior year Other cost mitigation efforts help limit decremental to 25% in a segment that typically has basic incrementals of 35 to 40% before cost actions Moving to slide 16 to the precision and science technology segment Overall the segment have solely performance in these economic environment As adjusted orders were 219 million off 2% X of X Adjusted revenue was 192 million down 9% X of X On strong prior year comes up 12% X of X growth and shipment delays due to COVID-19 This platform is a collection of technologies and premium brands that have leadership positions in very attractive niche markets In the first quarter we saw orders growth high single digits in the legacy medical pump business As we are leading key player in several applications like oxygen concentrators respirators and liquid handling You can see many of the applications that our medical pump go into at the bottom of the page Our team have been working twenty four seven providing modified solutions that can be used for new applications to fight COVID-19 now and in the future The remainder of the portfolio saw slightly negative orders performance down 2% X of X with the majority due to COVID lockdowns in January and February in China and towards the end of the quarter in India What is encouraging is that we continue to see good funnel and all this activity across many of the prog lines and regions due to the niche applications in water and chemicals Which will help balance some of the expected weaknesses in a more industrial end market Moving to non- GAAP adjusted EBITA PNAC delivered $53 million in the quarter which is down 6% Non- GAAP adjusted EBITDA margin was 27.7% up 120 basis points driven by strong cost controls and productivity leading to the incremental margins of only 15% Moving to slide 17 and the specialty vehicle technology segment priorities for this segment are to continue to capture growth in a profitable manner We see that these segment can expand margins with the use of the same IRX tools we have used across all the segments and expect to see improvements of these business moving forward Having said that this business performed very well in the first quarter Adjusted orders were $230 million you know and adjusted revenue was $185 million up 8% and 7% respectively With the to bail of 1.15 Growth was driven by the strength in gold connectivity and consumer product line The business saw strong double digit order momentum in early January and February but as the pandemic hit the US we saw sharp decline in the second half of March While there is a lot to be excited about we're expecting Q2 to be down compared to last year for a couple of reasons First last year was a tough comp as a business had some supplier issues in the first quarter where some problem was shifted to the second quarter of 2019 And two the business is not immune to this current environment While April orders were down here a year we're starting to see some sequential improvement in orders We feel this is driven by a couple of factors First in the consumer we deem people to quickly to leveraging demand generation techniques wildly used in the legacy industrial businesses And we have seen better momentum recently in the run rate And second with the work we have done on proactive COVID prevention across all of our locations we were able to remain open while some of our competitors were closed Moving to non- GAAP adjusted EBITA specialty vehicles deliver $18 million in the quarter down 1% Non- GAAP adjusted EBITA was 9.9% which was down 80 basis points due to strategic growth investments ampword mix Moving to slide 18 and the high pressure solution segment In the business perform above our expectations in a tough operating environment with adjusted orders of $84 million and adjusted revenues of $96 million down 26% and 29% respectively I suspected the revenue base and the business was nearly 90% aftermarket And the team executed very well commercially with sequential adjusted orders up 6% and sequential adjusted revenues up 26% versus the fourth quarter of 2019 We continue to see shared gain opportunities in the aftermarket and specifically consumables where we saw orders and revenue up double digit sequentially These allowed us to deliver non- GAAP adjusted EBITA of $24 million and margins of 24.6% Which was down from last year level of 30.8% but sequentially better by over 400 basis points As we peep to the second quarter and rest of the year the key leading indicator for this business has always been activity and intensity We can measure that in multiple ways but the simplest form is the number of fleets operational in the market As a reminder each frac fleet has about 16 to 18 trucks with each truck carrying one pump Each pump has a fluid and every fluid end utilizes consumables While Q1 at 2020 on average we saw 318 active fleets The exit rate in March was 240 We expect to see a substantial drop in the second quarter where we believe is the active leads due to the recent dynamics in the market with the over supply and lower pricing for our info impact on revenues within the segment And because of that we're taking very proactive stands to drive the proper cost takeout to still show reasonable profitability in the quarters to come Moving to slide 19 we wanted to provide a quick Overall the total company is down approximately 20% in orders If the month began very slow particularly in US and European mar- by the order momentum throughout April we expect total revenue to be low In terms of orders both industrial technology and services and specialty vehicle segments were right in line with the total company average While precision and science technology is performing considerably better With positive year over year orders performance thus far as a result of continuous strength in medical pumps And not surprisingly the high pressure solution segment is not a As the market resets for what will likely be a prolonged downturn that we expect will last for a number of quarters As we look forward due to the uncertain environment that we find ourselves in we will not be providing Q2 or total year for the best manage our business and make sure we're taking the right steps to manage multiple scenarios to stress test the balance sheet and the associated impact on cash flows A current model shows that the business will in annual basis to be cashflow breakeven using certainly conservative assumptions Around working capital and CapEx Couple with the cost sactions we have taken thus far We feel that these puts us in a very solid position moving forward when compared to current order trends and coupled with our current liquidity position For instance like 20 for some concluding remarks I wanna say that we'll win manage through what we will no doubt be of top second quarter We feel that the fundamental investment thesis in the company has not changed Ingersoll Rand is a premier industrial company over our transformation We have multiple levers for accelerating creation While being very focused on the current our liquidity With opportunities to increase these by onlooking cash as well as taking advantage of the current rate environment We will continue to drive a culture of execution and we'll continue to pay attention to the particularly on the current condition is to be strategic on bolt-on acquisition With this we will turn to q&a At this time I would like to remind everyone in order to ask a question number one on your telephone key pad if you would like to remove yourself from the queue you may press the pound yourself to one question And w- Your first question comes from Andy Caplets from Citigroup Your line is open Good morning guys How are you Morning Andy Vicente can you give us more color into the April order decline you're seeing and your your largest segment in ITNS First of all how long do you think the change in customer behavior from that power tool business now have you know smaller optio- and exposure in IT Now so there're discernible differences in the run rate of these businesses uh given it's their more project versus the industrial compressor business Uh yeah Andy Let me just give you a little bit of color I mean as you saw we said roughly you know April total orders down 20% book-to-bill greater than one Uh from a book-to-bill perspective you know the uh industrial technology and the uh position on science where we're greater uh than one and obviously leading the way Uh I'll say you know in terms of in terms of IPS in particular you know I will categorize it as you know the uh the short cycle was mostly most impacted in the quarter and continue to see uh you know some relatively weakness uh here uh moving forward I mean it's it's it's mostly correlated to uh I guess maybe the PMI Uh you know from uh from the down in the mainstream which is what we consider to be more on the loan cycle Uh I'll say you know comparatively a bit more stable uh in the first quarter And uh and and we kind of continue to see maybe some of that in the month of April Uh again typically we tend to get the orders for that loan cycle now in the first half of the year in order to get shipments uh in the second half Um and uh and and and from a PPL p- from a power tool perspective yeah I mean rough rough quartering uh in the in the in in Q1 uh as as I alluded I mean last year they we're seeing some fairly good growth momentum from uh their expansion into online uh retailers And uh and you saw that uh in the first quarter many of these only reta- retailers they moved uh to having other kind of more household goods or or or critical needs uh to fight COVID uh COVID-19 And clearly you know these business uh saw some of the impact I'd say April sale is uh relatively slow So we haven't seen the uh the uh the people that with the momentum of uh of the power tool business So that that's helpful Vicente and I'm sure you you expected us to ask about decremental margin in some way So so let me just ask it like this Um obviously you know good result in Q1 of close to 30 you know how do I think about decrementals with high pressure solutions You know the orders down 80% Can you hold decremental there in the mid forties At what point you know the fixed costs become a problem I know you talked about accelerating the rest of the business Can the rest of the business hold 30% decrementals with the 20% decline that you're seeing overall in the rest of the business Yeah So so I'll say Andy I mean that's that's kinda what we're targeting for And uh uh I mean uh as you have seen you know we have performed well in the down cycles in the past Uh I think we have a good solid playbook that we that we executed in the in the 15 16 that included both not only the in industrial downturn but also uh an upstream downturn Uh you know base decrementals they tend to be around 40% across the business with a slightly higher in uh in businesses like uh uh the high pressure as you mentioned as well as the uh precision and signs because of the nice uh high gross margins that both businesses have And you know lower on the specialty vehicles and uh the indulgent technologies they tend to play in that kind of 40 pers- 40% range Uh you know your seeing that we have taken very decisive actions between synergies and the short-term actions uh to protect the margin Uh we saw as we've mentioned you know some very good first quarter results for the total business under 30% and and Q2 we clearly see a bit more pressure from a topline perspective but we will continue to manage decrementals with the target being closer closer to that 30% uh of uh of uh of of of of the And you know when you think about the actions we're we're clearly taking much more aggressive actions in the high pressure uh around course actions based on what we see here with a lot of our data points and uh and the long duration of the downturn that we expect that business to have Very helpful Vicente Stay well Thank you You too Andy Your next question comes from Julian Mitchell from Barclays Your line is open Hi good morning Um- Good morning Julian M- morning Maybe just a a first question on that point on decremental margins Um so if you could help us understand perhaps the phasing of the uh cost synergies through the year and also of that um 40 to 50 million of of other costs out actions and should those mean that decremental margins narrow or not necessarily depending on mix and some other things He maybe break it down into the two buckets uh as as you suggest to me on the 40 to 50 that we spoke about uh that are kind of more related to uh discretionary or kind of volume related Those are largely second quarter and the third quarter uh with a good majority I would say more more so on the uh on the second quarter Uh from my from the cost synergy perspective million dollars uh you know probably 80 to $90 million of end year Um you know growth and downturn I would say that it's kind of consistent third quarter and fourth quarter while the other roughly you know 10 to $20 million that comes from procurement it is really more weighted towards that kind of Q3 and Q4 Then maybe just my uh second question um for you or for Emily around the free cash flow is that a good performance in Q1 Uh just wondered you know you- the assumptions around a a break even free cash But assume we play out um you know what kind of you know of sales are down called it 20 25% for the year What type of free cash flow conversion uh should we expect You know how do you see working capital moving You heard I think in the free cash that $63 million uh of transaction and separation cash cost in Q1 what's the rough uh assumptions for the year Um yes We're very pleased with with the Q1 cash performance as you as you saw there Julian And we've been managing cash um you know from to put in good processes and strong controls around it uh given the current crisis We we we expect cash to still be to move forward but certainly a longer cash cycle as we move through um wi- And we're really managing you know payments as to the collections were receiving to maintain our strong cash flow and liquidity positions Um you know what the future holds Um a lot of that's you know gonna depend o- um for sure but we know we'll maintain our cash position in our liqui- And how about the cost Is there any very rough g- I'd post for the year uh in light of about 63 million in Q1 There'll be some some incremental Um I don't have the I don't have the figure at my fingertips at the moment Julian but I can I can get back to you on that Your next question comes from Michael Holleran from Viad Good morning everyone Hope everyone's doing well So so could we just talk about the the synergy funnel you referenced You know what what are some of the incremental sources o- You originally identified 250 M- Maybe talk about the difference you've seen no longer terms some of the revenue synergy opportunities you see Yeah a a a as you recall you know we always said that uh that we were going for uh you know as we with 60 days pays into uh into into into the transaction we have all these serviceability as to what that funnel could uh could could potentially be Roughly the a $100 million comes from a combination of structural savings Uh a rationalization kind of non-manufacturing", "pred_text": "caterer for after market activity which is approximately fifty percent of the compressor business today for original equipment we're using the man generation leap we said in the past that the man gen was a leading indicator of orders that we will be getting in the next six to eight weeks with more than a thousand lease per week we have a lot of commercial inside in our system what we saw in the later weeks of march was a drop of thirty percent versus what we saw earlier in the quarter with similar trends in america and europe we have seen also early signs of improvement over the past two weeks of april but still approximately twenty to twenty five percent off from the highs in the early part of the year let me give you now some color from a pro life perspective we have seen very similar trains across compressors blowers and vacuums where we saw orders down in the meat to hiking go digits we have spoken about third party industry reports in the past and the key one data speaks well for the outcome of the combining of the two companies according to a leading third party report the market in the u s was down missing go digits in dollars in the first quarter garnish number brand the products were flat and ingest around the product was down high single digits but when you look into the details you see the power of the two companies have gone to them or so good share gains on low to medium horse power machines while in this around to share on high horse power compressors this was exactly a hypothesis coming into the deal and we see this as a way to leverage the technology portfolio as well as the direct and indirect channel that both companies have our tools a lift which is part of the segment had a very tough quarter with orders and revenue down both over twenty percent the business was highly impacted by large inventory purchases that online retailers typically make in the first quarter to support first half of the year revenue however this quarter in addition to the slowdown of the market many online retailers switch their focus to household essentials moving to non gap adjusted i can as a lever one hundred thirty five million dollars in the quarter which was down twenty five percent loan gap adjusted margin what seventeen percent which was down one hundred fifty versus points when the prior year cause mitigation efforts help limit the criminal to twenty five percent in a segment that typically has basically thirty five to forty percent before cost actions moment is like sixteen to the precision and science technology segment overall the segment had solid performance in these economic environment as adjusted orders were two hundred eighty million two percent x effects just the revenue was one hundred ninety two million down one percent x effects on strong prior year comes up twelve percent effects growth and ship in delays due to cover nineteen this platform is a collection of technologies and premium brands that have leadership positions in very attractive which markets in the first quarter we saw orders growth high single digit in the legacy medical pump business as we are leading key player in several applications like oxygen concentrators respirators and liquid handling you can see many of the patients that our medical palms go into other bottom of the page to be working twenty four seven providing modified solutions that can be used for new applications to fight cover nineteen now and in the future the remainder of the portfolio saw a slightly negative order performance down to percent ex effect with a majority due to cobbettowns in january and february china and towards the end of the quarter in india what is encouraging is that we continue to see good final and orders activity across many of the program and regions due to the need to cations in water and chemicals which will help balance some of the expected weaknesses in a more industrial and market moving to long gap adjusted with b s t deliver fifty three million dollars in the quarter which is down six percent gap adjusted even margin was twenty seven point seven percent up one hundred twenty basis points driven by strong cost controls and productivity leading to the commercial margins of only fifteen percent going to light seventeen and the specialty vehicle technology segment priorities for this segment are to continue to capture growth profitable manner we see that these segments can expand margins with the use of the same iraq tools we have used across all the segments and expect to see improvements of this business moving forward having said that this business performed very well in the first quarter just that orders were two hundred thirty million dollars and adjusted revenue was one hundred eighty five million dollars eight percent and seven percent respectively with a book the bill of one point one five growth was driven by the strength in gold connectivity and consumer problems the business saw strong double digit order momentum in early january and february but at the time he did the u s we saw a sharp decline in the second half of march but there is a lot to be excited about we're expecting q two to be down compared to last year for a couple reasons first last year was a top comp as a business had some supplier issues in the first quarter where some product was shifted to the second quarter of two thousand one thousand and two the business is not immune to these current environment while april orders were down year we're start to see some sequential improvement in orders we feel this is driven by a couple factors first in the consumer prop line then people to quickly to leverage in the man generation techniques widely used in the legacy industrial businesses and we have seen better momentum recently in the runway and second with the work we have done a proactive college prevention across all of our locations we were able to remain open while some of our competitors were closed moving to non gap adjusted because specialty vehicles deliver eighty million dollars in a quarter down one percent no gap but just thirty was nine point nine percent which was down eighty basis points due to strategic growth investments and product makes going to light eighteen and a high precious solution segment the business perform above and operating environment with just the orders of eighty four million dollars and adjusted revenues of ninety six million dollars down twenty six percent and twenty nine percent respectively i suspect of the revenue base in the business was nearly ninety percent up the market and the team executed very well commercially with sequential adjusted orders of six percent and sequential adjust the revenues of twenty six percent versus the fourth quarter of two thousand and we continue to see share gain opportunities nasa market and specifically consumables where we saw orders and revenue double digits question this allowed us to deliver non gap adjusted of twenty four million dollars a margins of twenty four point six percent which was down from last year level of thirty point eight percent but sequentially better by over four hundred interest points as we feel to the second quarter and rest of the year a key leading indicator for this business has always been activity and intensity we can measure that in multiple ways but the simplest form is a number of fleets operational in the market as a reminder each rack fleet has about sixteen to eighteen trucks with each truck carrying one pump each palm has a flu and every fluid and utilizes consumables or q want to twenty twenty on average we saw three hundred eighteen actively the exit rate in march was two hundred forty we expect to see a substantial drop in the second quarter where we believe actively due to the recent dynamics in the market with the oversupply and lower pricing for impact on revenues within the segment because of that we're taking very practical stand to drive proper cost takeout to still show reasonable profitability in the quarter to come to line nineteen we want to provide a quick national overall the total company down approximately twenty percent in orders at the month began very slow particularly in u s and european mark by the order momentum throughout april respect total revenue to be low in terms of orders both industrial technology and services and specialty vehicle segments were right in line with the total company average and science technology is performing considerably better with positive year over year orders performance thus far as a result of continuous strength in medical pumps and not surprisingly the high pressure solution segment is down to the market reset for what will likely be a prolonged downturn that we expect will last for a number of quarters as we look forward due to the uncertain environment that we find ourselves in we will not be providing q two or total year to best manage our business and sure we're taking the right steps to manage multiple scenarios to stress test the balance sheet and the associated impact on cash flows occur model shows that the business was an on a basis to be cash flow break even using fairly conservative assumptions around working capital and capital coupled with the cost factions we have taken thus far we feel that these puts us in a very solid position moving forward when compare to current order trends and coupled with our current equipment position branches like twenty four some concluding remarks say that what we manage through what we will no doubt be a top second quarter we feel that the fundamental investment thesis in the company has much change around is a premier industrial company over transformation we have multiple levers for accelerating valid creation or being very focused on the current liquidity with us to increase by only cash as well as taking advantage of the current rate environment we will continue to drive a culture of execution and we continue to pay attention to the particularly on the current condition to be strategic on both on acquisition with this will at this time i would like to remind everyone in order to ask a question one on your telephone keep if you would like to remove yourself from the queue you may press the pound yourself to one question and your first question comes from andy capolitz from citi group your line is open good morning how are you sent a can you give us more color into the april order declines you're seeing largest segment and i t first of all i want to think the changing customer behavior from that power tool business exposure in i t s or there discernible differences in the run rate of these businesses given it's there more project versus the industrial compressor business yeah i mean let me give you a little bit of color i mean as you saw we said roughly you know april total orders down twenty percent book to bill greater than one from a book to bill perspective you know the industrial technology and the position of science where were greater than one and obviously in the way you know in terms in terms of ideas in particular you know i will categorize it as you know the short cycle with mostly most impacted in the quarter and continue to see you know some of the witness here moving forward i mean it's mostly correlated to maybe the pm i you know from from the down of the mainstream which is what we consider to be more on the loan cycle you know comparatively a bit more stable in the first quarter and and we kind of continue to see maybe some of that in the month of april again typically we tend to get the orders for that motorcycle now in the first half of the year in order to get shipment in the second half and and from a p t o from a power to perspective yeah i mean rough rough quarter in the in the one as i noted i mean last year they were seeing some fairly good growth momentum from their expansion into online retailers and you saw that in the first quarter many of these only retailers they moved to have another kind of more household goods or critical needs to fight covid covid nineteen and clearly you know business saw some of the impact april sale is relatively slow so we haven't seen the the people that are the momentum of the powerful business so that's helpful to send and i'm sure you expect us to ask about detrimental margin in some way so let me just ask it like this some you know good result in q one of close to thirty how do i think about decrement with high pressure solutions you know the orders down eighty percent can you hold decremental there in the mid forty's at what point the fixed cost problem i know you talked about accelerated the rest of the business and the rest of the business hold thirty percent that commentals with the twenty percent decline that you're seeing overall in the rest of the business and the i mean that's that's kind of what we're targeting for and i mean as you have seen you know we have performed well in the down cycles in the past i think we have a good solid playbook that we that we executed in the in the fifteen sixteen that included both not only in industrial downturn but also an option downturn you know basically comment those they tend to be around forty percent across the business with slightly higher in businesses like the high pressure as you mention as well as the precision and science because of a nice high gross margins of businesses have and you know lower on the specialty vehicles and also technology they tend to play in that kind of forty percent forty percent range you know you seeing that we have taken very decisive actions between synergies and the short term actions to protect the margin we saw as you mentioned you know some very good first quarter results for the total business on their thirty percent and q two would be a bit more pressure from a topline perspective but we will continue to manage the committals with the target being closer closer to that thirty percent and you know when you think about the actions were were clearly taken much more aggressive actions on the high pressure around close action based on what we see here with a lot of our data points and the long duration of the downturn that we expect that business to have very helpful to send a stay well thank you your next question comes from julian mitchell from barclays your line is open hi good morning morning maybe just a first question on that point on decremental margins so if you could help us understand perhaps the phasing of the cost synergies through the year and also forty to fifty million of the cost out actions and those mean that decremental margins narrow or not necessarily depending on mix and some other things maybe break it down into the two buckets you suggest to me of the forty to fifty that we spoke about that are kind of related to discretionary or kind of volume related those are largely second quarter in the third quarter with a good majority i'll say more more so on the on the second quarter from a from the cost energy perspective million dollars you know i don't believe eighty to ninety million dollars of year you know count and i'll say that is kind of consistent third quarter and fourth quarter while the other roughly you know ten to twenty million dollars that comes from procurement it is really more weighted towards that kind of q three and q four and then maybe just my second question for you or for emily about the free cash flow had a good performance in q one just wonder you know you have your assumptions around direct take even free cash but assume play out you know what kind of you know i've sells it down call it twenty twenty five percent for the year what type of free cash flow conversion should we expect how do you see working capital moving you had i think in the free cash that sixty three million dollars transaction and separation cash cost what's the rough assumption for the very pleased with with the key one cash performance as you saw there julian and we've been managing you know from to put in good processes and strong controls around it given the current crisis we we expect have to still be to move forward but certainly longer cash cycle as we move through and we're really managing you know payments as the collections we're receiving to make maintain our strong cash flow and liquidity position you know what the future holds a lot of that you know going to depend on for sure but we know maintain our cash position and our liquid and how about the costs any very rough for the year in light of that sixty three million in one will be an incremental i don't have the i don't have the figure my fingertips at the moment julian but i can get back to your next question comes from michael holler from baird morning everyone's doing well so so could you talk about the synergy final reference what are some of the incremental sources that you originally identified two hundred fifty maybe talk about the difference you see no longer term some of the new synergy opportunities or so as you recall you know we'll said that we were going for you know as we were sixty days into into into into into into into into into into into into the transaction we have always service ability as to what that form could potentially be roughly one hundred million dollars comes from a combination of structural savings rationalization kind of non manufacture alluded to", "wer": 0.33136094674556216, "tokens": 3211,

the uh uh the locations across the world And that is given us a very good way for us to really understand and rationalize uh not so much the m- are coming year two year three but more more the uh the older kind of perspective So so um the second part of the question um liquidity is in a strong position Um you know some of the the one-off things is operation um you know and and some of the extra things Emily just referenced Uh what would it take for you guys to be a little bit more aggressive with the with the cash outflow and then um secondarily are you to do that that we're going into uh some sort of recession here who knows how long opportunity is gonna few deploy capital more toward the M and A s- side of things over the next couple of years And are you positioned for that today and any kind of thoughts on how you're you're thinking really about that that capital side over the next six nine plus months Yeah no absolutely Mike I mean I think uh y- y- you know clearly over the next uh couple of years uh continue to be a a really part of our strategy Uh you know we see it's a very unique environment right now Uh we still see at this point in time some very good funnel on also very good funnel around you know Ingersoll technologies Uh but they're really more related towards Thank you Your next question comes from Nigel Co from Wolfe Research Your line is open Good morning How are you guys Yeah Good thanks Um so technical performance So a little bit performer performance And it seems like most of that came from the Legacy IR businesses Um can you just maybe just kind of spell out in a bit more detail how much that can be explained by the of the industrial of the I- Also what happened with service during the quarter Nigel what happened to what Yeah well what happened to s- our service Yeah Yeah I think uh uh uh tell me China was definitely impacted largely in in in January and February Uh the Legacy IR business they have a printer with sizeable uh China uh exposure Uh uh you know in terms of in terms of the service uh you know we we we still serve as better typically we typically we sold roughly about two times from a percentage perspective Better performance than that than the original equipment And just to kind of give you uh maybe a little bit more color here uh particularly as as you know ways of comparing some of the You know the industrial technology is composed of multiple technologies Compressors vacuums and blowers And uh a c- compressor business is clearly within the When we are specifically compare to some other competitors couple of data points that we look at So the third party report uh uh at the same time you know to just to give you a further perspective the Legacy Gardner Denver business in Q1 orders were down in the low single- in the market And uh you know since since we since we didn't own the Legacy IR for the full quarter uh we just tend to not comment on what we saw specifically you know- I mean in February that they sold from an order perspective But that hopefully gives you a good perspective as to how on even on the legacy Great thanks Thanks V- Vicente Business This this business is so small na- that's so much involvement but if if if if it is down 8% in the quarter implies you know I mean is it possible to to given that you're kind of expecting this business to to be k- kind of like for longer uh yeah would you expect revenues to kind of like just bounce on the trough here So for next several quarters I mean any any count that would be helpful Yeah And I also so for sure you know that's what we're targeting to be you know the bre- breakeven and even even positive Uh I mean we're taking some pretty pretty aggressive actions A hundred percent after market and consumable So that that kind of carries a much better uh margin profile too as well And you know those factories that are kind of not uh not not uh needed based on volume I mean we're basically keeping them uh close or or very very low uh exposure So he had a good playbook on how how to navi- have done extensive work A- and uh you know I think we we see that we can definitely overcome these kind of long-term term And our plan is that it's gonna be down for a while Uh and and to the same question you know I mean clearly it's a it's a it's a market that as you saw we just invested in a new fluid and technology So and you know we can be ready for capturing s- Great Thanks very much Our next question comes from Jeff Sprague from Vertical Research Partners Thank you Good morning everyone Um- Morning to you W- why don't we just come back to service for a moment Vincente uh interesting comment about the utilization down from uh 30% But how do we actually interpret and a- a- apply that to a forward sales are gonna be down 30% and the serv- does not believe I don't know if you have enough data historically uh to kind of piece that together but what does that down 30% tell you Yeah Jeff uh great question I hinted uh so in terms of the historical data we don't have a lot of historical because as you know as you can imagine a lot of these remote uh monitoring systems and connectivity with the IOT platforms that we both companies have now uh is fairly new Uh but we have enough data to to then break it down by the specific uh uh sub and market The indication here is that it finally know where are those market that we should continue to play or double down from a service perspective So it's helping us to redirect the teams Uh it is also helping us to really better uh serve our customers and making sure that we're still more resilient from that perspective You know in terms of in terms of being down 30% uh I mean I think we just see that as as a bit of indication as to what could happen here here uh but uh as you he was a great correct correlation of We don't have a lot of historical data to So what we're doing is just taking that data point to keep focusing them on those areas regions and markets that uh that we're still seeing some very good utilization of their compressors And and any answers You noted ITS obviously includes more than compressors that Are you suggesting that uh those other sort of products ar- areas outside of vacuums and blowers were substantial Yes So for sure yes I mean for sure the uh the power tool and the lifting business uh uh was one that it was worse uh than that Uh I mean the power tools as CATs uh they have uh two main product lines I mean it's that tool business but also they have uh a a lifting business uh that is kind of more related to to factory consumption or factory uh rationalization So I think you know that that was impacted uh more so uh and then China as a region was definitely uh uh heavily impacted Uh and uh you know from uh from the other product lines in terms of the longer cycle uh which these are kind of brands like a uh Nash Gil and Liko Green Vacuums Those are more longer cycle and those were I would say more stable and resilient Right Thank you Your next question comes from David Rosseau from Evercore ISI Your line is open Good morning Uh my question's about in the ITS the inventory and the channel And you think about some of the recent improvement you've seen Can you give us some sense on any sequential improvement sort of a leader lag Okay And also the mix so your business is being short cycle versus long cycle Can you just give us some sense of the inventory in those channels The the lag you would need to see or that you would experience if if say the PMI has got better for example Uh yeah There I mean I think you know when when look when we look at the inventory in those channels uh I mean there's just no- these from a from a compressor perspective Which is obviously the one that has uh the biggest size of the distribution that work And and it is also a more particularly towards the Garner Denver branded products Uh you know we don't tend to have a lot of inventory because these these are particularly smaller distributors more so uh more than localized They don't tend to to put a lot of cash upfront to have compressors on the shelf so to speak I mean maybe on the smaller compressors they they may Uh but not on the medium to high level compressors And and the inventory will come in more on consumables aftermarket I'm really move fairly uh fa- fairly well I mean they turn pretty quickly Vicente just so I'm clear is it a stabilization at a low level after the initial shock in ITS or have you seen some you know little improvement in order sequentially And I'll be curious is that more short cycle or long cycle Yeah I know Yeah Great question Yeah it is I would I would categorize it as a set of civilization and uh uh initially and then obviously when you look within the month I mean a- at the month of April you know there some uh slight improvement on the second half of April c- But again was that more short cycle improvement Short cycle Yeah More short cycle Yeah Short cycle All right Thank you v- Thank you very much Appreciate it Sure Your next question comes from Josh Poklinsky f- is open Hi good morning all Morning Josh Um so Vicente I guess you know e- everyone here on the call kind of have same most questions tha- So we covered a lot of ground already Um but I guess you know just with some of the commentary around utilization um and with the comments you made around supply chain interruption how much of the decline that you're seeing and yeah I guess this comment is mostly an ITNS comment Is related to you know customer shut downs or supply chain interruption in in some form like you know the lights come back on and a certain amount of demand comes back 'Cause I I I think some of these points on you know service or utilization that maybe that's not the the the steady state you know state of the world there Yeah Just I'll say more so uh I I I in in China Uh if I if you wanna think about it kind of that uh disruption uh completely Uh also in the in the first quarter maybe some disruption uh from the perspective of uh in in Europe particularly in Italy Uh I mean we do have some very good manufacturing base in Italy Uh and and and we although we stayed operationally I mean most of our suppliers had to shut down Uh uh I I would say that uh now uh as kind of the comment that I made before we see kind of these lower demand level kind of getting more stabilized Uh but uh but you know still you know not seeing that uh that kind of recovery and we're just kind of waiting to see how the recovery will will play out Okay then switching over to the uh to the synergy funnel I mean it sounds like the the year three um a pipeline of activity you know kind of has to stay there as you know back on other things first since we're manufacturing centric Fair to say that the incremental step up in synergies than in the year two is it's smaller I guess is you know it's just more of a pull forward from year two or or you kind of implicitly saying Hey we think there's more than 250 here We're just you know we're working on this as fast as we can and we'll update you as we know more Yeah I mean I think that's exactly the case We think we think uh we wanna keep it at 250 just because we think it's prudent Uh and and we think it's prudent because we're we're I mean clearly focused on a lot of the uh internal funnel and execution You see how we accelerated and we executed I mean this is not just talking about the executed but there's a component around procurement and uh and uh and I to be savings uh innovative value that is going independent And when we did a 250 mi- million dollar customers in your funnel it was on based on 2019 kind of uh uh runway level so to speak or spend levels So we just wanna be prudent from uh from kind of going out there and saying that the 250 will increase Uh you know once we're we're ready we'll definitely And when we see as kind of more stability or noma- normalization in the markets maybe we come back with that But at this point in time we're we're accelerating what we can control And we know that we can control that structural head countdown And that's exactly what we executed We know we can control a lot of the quick gains in procurement because commodities are lower and we are executing that and we know we can control a lot of discretionary spend and that's exactly what we also executed So we're very focused on kind of going through the list of things that we can really execute Right Appreciate the color Your next question comes from Nathan Jones from Stiefel Your line is open Morning everyone Morning Nathan Hey uh you know revenue down 8.6 X FX margins up 120 basis points So clearly some very good control lag on what drove the very good decremental there Uh how do you say the decremental is going forward and and maybe any color you can give us on what you think the long term margin opportunities in that business Hey Nathan this is uh uh uh you know I'll I'll say some very good cost controls but also some very good momentum that we had also from the medical uh business If you remember last year when we talked about the medical business we were seeing upwards of 200 basis points margin improvement and the medical business finishing last year at roughly you know 30 31% uh EBITDA margin So again very good momentum from that business And and and clearly as we saw some suppliers in the market the team continued to execute those uh targets that they needed they needed needed to get done You know I think e- when when when when when you look at this business that uh I mean has some very nice gross margins and uh you know the decremental the base decrementals are typically you know 45 or so I mean pretty good job that the team data here in order to get that decremental down to the 15% Uh and I'll say you know from a long-term perspective we'll we'll definitely come come back uh with with with giving some kind of medium to longterm perspective I'll just do a quick comparison then you can see that medical we were able to uh you know not not only you know just a few years ago that medical business wasn't the 25 26% EBITDA margin And we finished you know last year in the 31% EBITDA margin And there's a just a lot of good commonalities between the medical and the Legacy uh you know PFS on Aero business that are within this segment Okay Maybe just a one on receivables Um when you look through that do you see any customer credit risk any col- risk there I guess it's particularly an upstream comment uh given the way given the way that market's going but anywhere else you see you know any potential issues in receivables how are you going about managing customer credit Those kinds of things I mean I would say not necessarily They I mean I think it's r- it's one that we we we we we live by day by day I mean clearly the uh on the uh on the high-pressure solution which is as you just mentioned the most exposed I mean customers are still paying Uh they take longer to pay but they still pay Uh you know they they they also realize that uh you know from an upstream perspective that our business is critical and essential for when the market comes back up again So uh we have been pretty strict in uh in many cases that uh that we need to see the payments or we will stop shipments And then we seize uh to to provide any type of uh any type of uh uh output of products e- either now or later in the in the future So I think we're we're we're we're we're really executing a good playbook here on on collections for the teams Excellent Thank you Thank you Your next question comes from Nicole Deblase from Deutsche Bank Your line is open Uh yeah Thanks Good morning guys Good morning Nicole Um so a lot of this has been answered We've covered a lot of ground so far but I just wanted to ask one um into next year as we think about you know approaching or recovery there's clearly a lot of moving pieces here We've got you know more structural cost savings coming through presumably you have temporary costs probably coming back to the business And then just kind of dovetailing all of that with typical incremental margins I'm not sure you know how best you can do this Vicente but it would be really you know helpful to kind of characterize the way you see incrementals coming out you know on the other side of this downturn Yeah I know so yeah that that's so great I mean I think I think you know we typically see kind of the base uh what I call the base level of incremental to be you know for the total business between 35 to 40% Uh again you know when you look at uh precision and science maybe higher than that uh specialty vehicles uh lower than that where maybe industrial technology is about that level Uh you know definitely we'll we'll we'll see a little bit of a headwind uh as we see a lot of these uh structural activities that we're doing to to come through fruition Uh we also see a lot of uh you know tailwinds uh I'm sorry We see tailwinds that a lot of these kind of structural costs come out We see some of some of the headwinds uh but you know as as we kind of get closer to uh coming out here to our budgets and how we kind of work work with the teams we'll definitely find ways on how we can continue to get that incremental margin obviously uh to be at a minimum at bad days or more Okay Your next question comes from John Wells from Credit Suisse Your line is open Sorry Your next question is from Markus Nitton Meyer from UBS Your line is open Yeah Hi good morning everybody Good morning Markus Uh one more on the uh on the Hi Hi good morning Uh on on synergies I I do appreciate that obviously procurement is uh volume dependent but um you flag your 10 to 20 million savings realized in 2020 Um what you", "pred_text": "we have now a pretty good database all the locations across the world and that is giving us a very good way for us to really understand and rationalize not so much the coming year to year three but more more the other kind of perspective so second part of the question liquidity is a strong position you know some of the one off things just operation and some of the extra things i just referenced what would it take you guys to be a little bit more aggressive with the cash outflow and then secondarily over there to that that we're going into sort of recession here who knows how long his fertility is going to excel it the play capital more toward things over the next couple years and you position for that today and any kind of thoughts and i think about that capital side over the next six nine plus months mike i mean i think you know clearly over the next couple years continue to be really part of our strategy you know we see it's a very unique environment right now we still see at this point time some very good phone also a very good phone around you know those are technologies but they're really more related toward on thank you your next question comes from nigel co from wolf research your line is open good morning how you got yeah good thanks for months a little bit form a foreman seems like most of that came from the legacy businesses maybe just kind of a bit more detail how much of that can be explained by the industrial of the also what happened to say this during the quarter to what you know what happened i would say this yeah think i mean china was definitely impacted largely in january and february the latest eye our business they have pretty sizable china exposure you know in terms of in terms of the service you know we saw service better typically we saw roughly about two times from a percentage perspective better performance than that than the original equipment and just to kind of give you maybe a little bit more color here particularly you know the ways of comparing some of the you know industrial technology is composed of multiple technologies compressors back in the blowers and present business is clearly within the when we specifically compare to some of the compared first couple of data points that we look at the third party report at the same time you know just to give you a further perspective the legacy garner denver business in q one orders were down in the low single in the market and you know since since we didn't own the legacy i are put a full quarter which is then to not comment on what we saw specifically you know every that they saw from an order perspective but that you are good perspective at the hot form even on the legacy business becomes so small now it's so much evolvement but if it is down eight percent in the quarter that implies you know is it possible to given you could expect in the business to be kind of like we could for longer you would expect revenue to kind of like to pounce on the truck here the next several quarters mean any any kind of helpful for sure you know that's what we're targeting to be you know the great break even even positive i mean we're taking some pretty pretty aggressive actions one hundred percent after marketing consumables so that kind of carries a much better margin profile to us well and you know those factories that are kind of not not needed based on volume i mean we're basically keeping them close or or very very low exposure so a good playbook on how to not have done extensive work and you know i think we can definitely overcome these kind of longer our plan is that it's going to be down for a while and to the second question you know i mean clearly the market that as you so we just invested in new fluid and technology so you know we can be ready for capturing great thanks very much our next question comes from jeff sprout from vertical research partners thank you good morning everyone just come back to service for a moment interesting comment about utilization down thirty percent but how do we actually interpret and apply that to a forward sales are going to be down thirty percent of the service i don't believe you have enough data historically to kind of piece that together but what does that down thirty percent tell you a great question in terms of the historical data we don't have a lot of historical because you know as you can imagine a lot of these remote monitoring systems and connectivity with the platforms that we both companies have now is fairly new but we have enough data to them break it down by the specific and mark the indication here is that it telling those where are those market that we should continue to play or double down from a service perspective so it's helping us to redirect the team it is also helping us to really better serve our customers and making sure that we're still more resilient from that perspective you know in terms of in terms of being down thirty percent i mean i think we just see that as as a bit of indication as to what could happen here but as you he was a great correlation and we don't have a lot of historical data to so what we're doing is just thinking that they are going to be focusing them on those areas regions and markets that we're still seeing some very good utilization of the compressors and the answers noted i p s obviously includes more than compressors tax are you suggesting that those other products are areas outside of act and blowers were substantial yes a for sure poor yes i mean for sure the popul and lifting business was one that it was worse than that i mean the power tools they have two main programs i mean it's that tool business but also they have a lifting business that is kind of more related to factory consumption or factory rationalization so i think you know that that was impacted more so and then china as a region was definitely heavily impacted and you know from from the other product lines in terms of the longer cycle which these are kind of brands like nash garole ponds and the green vacuum those are more longer cycle and those were more stable and resilient thank you your next question comes from david ross so from evercore i s i your line is open good morning my questions about in the i ts been torn the channel and you think of about some of the recent improvement you see give us some sense on any sequential improvement sort of a lead lag and also the mix of your businesses being short cycle versus long cycle can just give us some sense of the inventory in those channel lag you would need to see that you would experience if say the p m i've got better for example i think you know when we look at the inventory in those channel i mean there's just not these from a from a compressor perspective which is obviously the one that has the biggest size of the distribution network and it is also more particularly towards the garnered denver brand the problems you know we don't tend to have a lot of inventory because these are particularly smaller distributors more sub regionalized more localized they don't tend to put a lot of cash up front to have compressors on the shelf so to speak i mean maybe on the smaller pressers they may not on the medium to high level compressors and the inventory will come in more on consumables after market and really fairly fairly well i mean they turn pretty quickly you've seen just home clear is that a stabilization at a low level after the national shock and i ts or have you seen some little improvement in order sequentially and i'd be curious is that more short cycle or long cycle i know you a great question it is out of it as the step stabilization and initially and then obviously when you look at it within the month i mean the month of april you know there are light improvement on the second half of a program but again was that more short cycle improvement or cycle short cycle all right thank you thank you very much appreciate it your next question comes from josh is open hi good morning so this and i guess you know everyone here on the call kind of same last question so we covered a lot of ground already just with some of the commentary around utilization and with the comments made around supply chain how much of the decline you're seeing and i guess this comment is mostly in nineteen that's comment interwated to customer shutdowns or supply chain interruption and in some form like you know the lights come back on and a certain amount of demand comes back and i think some of these points on service or utilization that maybe that's not the steady state of the world there yeah just i'll say more so in china if you want to think about it kind of that disruption completely also in the in the first quarter maybe some disruption from the perspective of in europe particularly in italy i mean we do have some very good manufacturing a few needily and we although we stayed operationally i mean most of our suppliers had to shut down i would say that now kind of the comment that i made before we see kind of these lower demand level kind of getting more stabilized but but you know still you know not seeing that that kind of recovery and we're just kind of waiting to see how the recovery will play out ok then switching over to the to the synergy funnel i mean it sounds like the year three pipeline of activity you have to say there on other things for since one factor and centric fair to say that the incremental step up in energy then and here to smaller i guess you know this more of a pull forward from your two or are you kind of implicitly saying hey we think there's more than two hundred and fifty here we're just you know we're working on this fast as we can walk to us we don't want you to think we think we want to keep it up to fifty just because we think it's prudent and we think it's prudent because we're i mean clearly focus on a lot of the internal funnel and execution you see how we accelerated and we executed i mean this is not just talking about the executed but there's a component around procurement and i do be saving innovative value that is bomb independent and when we did a two hundred and fifty million dollars custody photo it was on based on two thousand kind of level so to speak of spend levels so we just want to be prudent from from kind of going out there and saying that that to fifty will increase you know once we're ready will definitely and when we see kind of more stability or no more normalization in the markets maybe we come back with that but at this point time we're we're accelerating what we can control and we know that we can control that structural head count out and that's exactly what we executed we know we can control a lot of the quickens and procurement of commodities are lower and we are executing that and we know we can control a lot of discretionary span and that's exactly what we also executed so we're very focused on kind of going through the list of things that we can really execute car next question comes from nathan jones from steeple your line is open morning everyone revenue down point six x x margins up one hundred twenty basis point so clearly some very good control lag on what drug a very good decremental decrementals going forward and maybe any color you can give us some what you think the long term margin opportunities in that business is you know i'll say some very good cost control but also some very good momentum that we had also from the medical business if you remember last year when we talked about the medical business we were seeing upwards of two hundred bits of points margin improvements and the medical business finishing last year at roughly thirty one percent the margin so again very good momentum from that business and clearly as we saw some suffering the market the team continued to execute those targets that they need to get done you know i think when you look at this business that i mean has some very nice growth margins and you know that the criminal that they decrementals are typically you know forty five or so i mean pretty good job that the team did here in order to get the criminal down to the fifteen percent and i'll say you know from a long term perspective will definitely come come back with giving some kind of medium to long term perspective i'll just do a quick comparison and you can see that medical we were able to you know not only you know just a few years ago that medical business was in the twenty five twenty six percent margin and we finished you know last year in the thirty one percent even the margin and there's a just a lot of good commonality between the medical and the legacy you know p f a that aero business that are within the segment maybe just one hundred saveables when you look through that do you see any customer credit risk any collection risk there i guess it's particularly an upstream comment given the way given the way that markets going to anywhere else you see any potential issues in receive a ball how you're going about managing customer credit those kinds of things i mean i think not necessarily i mean i think it is one that we live by day by day i mean clearly the on the on the hyper showing which is as you mentioned the most exposed i mean customers are still paying take longer to pay but they still pay you know they they also realize that you know from an option perspective that our business is critical and essential for when the market comes back up again so we have been pretty straight and in many cases that we need to see the payments or we will stop shipments and then we see to provide any type of output of product either now or later in the in the future so i think we're we're we're really executing a good playbook here on collections with a team excellent thank you your next question comes from the cold to blaze from bank your line is open morning guys so a lot of this is that answer we caught a lot of ground so far but i just wanted to ask why into next year as we think about you know approaching our recovery there's clearly a lot of moving pieces here we've got you know more structural cost savings coming through presumably you have temporary costs probably coming back to the business and then just kind of dovetailing all of that with typical incremental margins i'm not sure you know how best you can do this isn't a but it would be really you know helpful to kind of characterize the way you see incrementals coming out you know on the other side of this downturn i mean i think i think you know we typically see kind of the base what i call the base level of incremental to be you know put a total business between thirty five to forty percent again you know when you look at precision and science maybe higher than that specialty vehicles lower than that with maybe industrial technology about that level you know definitely will see a little bit of a headwind as we see a lot of these structural activities that we're going to come to fruition we also see a lot of you know tell windsor with the del wins that a lot of these kind of structural cost come out which is some of some of the headwinds but you know as we kind of get closer to coming out here to our budgets and how we can work with the teams will definitely find ways on how we can continue to get that incremental margin to be at a minimum like that days or more your next question comes from john walsh from credit suisse your line is open or your next question is from marcus meyer from u b s your line is open morning everybody took part of one more on the on this hike morning on energy i do appreciate that obviously procurement is volume dependent but ten to twenty million savings to your life in two thousand and twenty what you currently have", "wer": 0.34404865334491747,
